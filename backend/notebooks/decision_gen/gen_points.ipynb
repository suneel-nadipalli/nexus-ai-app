When the boat had sailed but a little way on the water of Meh, he found one of the friends of Set, and having hurled his spear at him, he caught him, and slaughtered him in the presence of Ra, at a place called Astabet. A truce for six days and six nights then followed, and Horus had rest, while Isis made use of her words of power to keep away Ba, i.e., Set, from the district called An-rut-f. Soon afterwards Horus slew 106 of the enemy, and then made a final attack upon them in the neighbourhood of An-hat and Tchar, or Tanis; some made their escape and succeeded in getting away to the mountains, and others threw themselves into the sea. Horus changed himself into the form of a lion, with the head of a man surmounted by the triple crown, and grasping in his hand his keen-edged knife he pursued them, and brought back 142 of the enemy, whom he slew, and he tore out their tongues, and their blood gushed out upon the ridges of the ground. When this was done Ra told Horus that he wished to travel further upon the sea, and to smite the remainder of his foes who still lived in the form of crocodiles and hippopotami near Egypt, but Horus told him that it was impossible to sail further on the sea because the one-third of the enemy which still remained were therein. When Thoth heard this he recited certain chapters containing magical formulae, with the view of protecting the Boat and the vessels of the blacksmiths which were with it, and of quieting the sea during the period of storm. It is clear that when these chapters had been recited, Ra and his company set out and went over the whole sea, but as no more enemies were seen they ceased.',\n",

In this statement we seem to have an allusion to the keen, fresh wind of dawn with which all travellers in the desert are well acquainted, and which usually blows about one hour before sunrise. In the region on the left hand side of Ra we see how punishment is inflicted upon the enemies of Ra, and in it we have a country of blazing fire. At one end stands Horus with a disk, surrounded by uraeus, upon his head, holding in his left hand a boomerang, one end of which terminates in the head of a serpent; the idea here suggested is that the weapon held by the god is a real serpent, which when thrown at an enemy will suddenly attach itself to his body after the manner of the vicious uraeus. The right arm of Horus rests on a staff whereon the god usually supports himself, and before him rears itself a huge serpent called \"Set of millions of years,\" if, the duty of which was to devour any of the enemies of Ra, i.e., the dead, who succeeded in making their escape from the fires of the country of the Eleventh Hour.

The first chamber or pit, Hafet, was filled with the bodies of fiends who were dashing out their own brains with axes, and was under the charge of a lion-headed goddess, called Hert-Ketit-s, who stood by its side and belched fire into it through her mouth; when the fire had done its work on the wretched creatures they were hacked to pieces by the huge knife which she held in both her hands.

The form in which the goddess was worshipped in the earliest times was that of a cat, and her identification with a lioness probably belongs to a comparatively late period. From the inscription we find that she was also identified with Rat, the female counterpart of Ra, and with Temt, the female counterpart of Tem; she is often called the eye of Ra, and the eye of Tem, and the Shetat, i.e., the Hidden one. According to one legend Bast was the personification of the soul of Isis, and was worshipped as such in Bubastis, and it was only at Bubastis of the South, i.e., Dendera, that she was regarded as the female counterpart of Tem. From the fact that she is associated with the god Sept, the lord of the East, it is tolerably certain that in one aspect at least she was regarded as a foreign goddess, whose attributes and characteristics had been transferred to her. As Temt, at Dendera, she was said to be the mother of the lion-headed god Ari-hes, the lord of Aphroditopolis the holy Sekhem, who dwelt in the temple of Bast of Dendera; her husband in this case was the god AN, who was a form of Osiris.

In the Judgment Scene in the Book of the Dead it is Thoth who acts the part of the recording angel, and it is his decision which is accepted by the gods, who ratify the same and report it to Osiris; for when once Thoth said that the soul of the deceased had been weighed, and that it had been found true by trial in the Great Balance, and that there was no wickedness whatsoever in it, the gods could not fail to answer, \"That which cometh forth from thy mouth is true,\" and the deceased is holy and righteous and in consequence they straightway award him a place with Osiris in the Sekhet Hetepu, or Elysian Fields.

The caravan men protect their camels from the Evil Eye of the spirits of the desert by fastening bright-coloured beads between the eyes of their beasts, and by means of long fringes which hang from their onahlufas, or saddles, and in spite of their firm belief in the infinite power of God, they select an auspicious day on which to set out on a journey, and they never attempt to pass certain isolated caves, or ravines, or mountains, in the night time. All the members of the great family of the Jinn are to them as real today as their equivalents were to the ancient Egyptians, and, from the descriptions of desert spirits which are given by those who have been fortunate enough to see them, it is clear that traditions of the form and appearance of ancient Egyptian fiends and evil spirits have been unconsciously preserved until the present day. The modern Egyptians call them by Arabic names, but the descriptions of them agree well with those which might be made of certain genii that appear in ancient Egyptian mythological works treating of the Underworld and its inhabitants. The peoples of the Eastern Sudan, who are also Muhammadans, have inherited many ideas and beliefs from the ancient Egyptians, and this is not to be wondered at when we remember that the civilization of Nubia from the beginning of the XVIIIth Dynasty to the end of the XXVIth, i.e., from about 1550 to about 550, was nothing but a slavish copy of that of Egypt. A stay of some months in the village at the foot of Jebel Barkal, which marks the site of a part of the old Nubian city of Napata, convinced me of this fact, and visits to other places in the Eastern Sudan proved that these ideas and beliefs were widespread. The hills and deserts are, according to native belief, peopled with spirits, which are chiefly of a disposition unfriendly to man, and they are supposed to have the power of entering both human beings and animals almost at pleasure. Palm-trees die or become unfruitful, and cattle fall sick through the operations of evil spirits, and any misfortune which comes upon the community or upon the individual is referred to the same cause. The pyramids, which they call tarabil, on the hill, are viewed with almost childish fear by the natives who, curiously enough, speak of the royal personages',\n",

On the other hand, it seems to me that M. MASPERO has somewhat underrated the character of the spiritual conceptions of the dynastic Egyptians, and that he has done so because, when he wrote his great article, La Mythologie Egyptienne, Egyptologists had not thoroughly realized the distinction which exists between the primitive or predynastic element in the Egyptian religion and the Asiatic element. This element was of a solar character undoubtedly, and was introduced into Egypt by the “Followers of Horus, or the “Blacksmiths, who invaded the country, and conquered the natives, and settling down there, built up the great dynastic civilization which we call Egyptian. This seems to be the correct explanation of the diversity of view of two such eminent experts, and the opposite character of their conclusions appears to be due chiefly to the difference of the standpoints from which they viewed the subject. A prolonged study of the religious and mythological texts of ancient Egypt has convinced me of the futility of attempting to reconcile the conflicting beliefs and to harmonize the contradictory statements which are found in them, so long as we regard the Egyptian religion as “one in its extension and principle. It must first of all be resolved into its constituent elements, and when this has been done, it will probably be possible to classify, and arrange, and assign to their proper sources the various material and spiritual conceptions and beliefs which the Egyptians heaped up in their minds and flung together in their religious writings.',\n",

Now we know from several passages in the Book of the Dead that Osiris, Ra, Nefer-Tem, Neb-er-tcher, Mehi, Hathor, and, in fact, all great gods were ministered to by a number of lesser gods, but none of these are of the importance of the followers of Horus, and none of them are as old. We have already seen that the original Horus god, if;Eﬁ, who represented the face of heaven, was supposed to have long hair which hung down from his face, and which probably supported it, and that in the myth of Shu the supports of this god, i.e., the four pillars which held up the vast, rectangular, iron plate that formed the floor of heaven were placed in the tresses of Horus. At a later period, when the four followers of Horus, son of Isis, were identified with the followers of the older Horus, these gods were made to dwell near the pillars of Shu and to have dominion over them, and also over the four quarters of heaven, and they took the place of the earlier gods of the cardinal points. In the Book of the Dead these four children of Horus play very prominent parts and the deceased endeavoured to gain their help and protection at all costs, both by offerings and prayers. In the pictures of the funeral procession four men draw along the coﬂin containing the mummied intestines of the deceased, four animals are taken for sacrifice, and all the instruments used in the ceremony of “opening the mouth,” as well as the vases and boxes of unguents, etc., are in quadruplicate. Even prayers and formulae are said four times over, e.g., in Chapter xl., the deceased in addressing the Eater of the Ass says, “I know thee, four times; and in Chapter cxxiv., he says, I am pure, four times. Most important of all, however, it was to remember that the four children of Horus shared the protection of the body of the deceased among them, and as far back as the Vth Dynasty we find that they presided over his life in the underworld.

We know from one or two passages in the Pyramid Texts that there were women in heaven just as there were goddesses, but they are not spoken of as are the Hūr al-‘uyūn (houris), i.e., the women with large, black pupils of the eyes set in large whites, who are mentioned in Arabic descriptions of Paradise, and they are not made to be one of the chief attractions of heaven. As far as can be seen, the heaven of the Egyptians had no musical instrument in it, and the only sounds heard in it must have been the songs of the ministering gods and of the beatified when they hymned the Great God. What the Egyptian gentleman who lives on his own land in places remote from towns is now, the Egyptian gentleman everywhere was then; he loved to wash and anoint himself, and having put on clean linen to sit in the sun in the morning, and to bear himself with dignity, and to be treated with respect by his neighbours and inferiors. He loved to have corn, and wine, and oil in abundance, and a sufficient number of slaves to minister to his wants and to maintain his dignity when he moved about from village to village. He honoured his mother, and usually married a very limited number of wives, among whom might be a sister, or half-sister, or cousin, and he took great interest in his male offspring. We note in the Pyramid Texts that the families of the deceased kings are never mentioned, and that nothing is said about their wives, although Unas (lines 628, 629) is said to carry off women from their husbands, wherever he pleaseth, whenever he pleaseth.

The primitive dwellers in Egypt undoubtedly belonged to a large and important section of the inhabitants of North-East Africa, and possessed physical and mental characteristics which were peculiar to themselves. In the earliest times they were savages, and lived and died like savages in other parts of the world; religious belief of any kind, in the modern sense of the term, they had none, and they probably regarded the animate and inanimate objects which they saw about them as akin to themselves. At a much later period they peopled the earth, air, sky, and water with beings of various kinds, and they paid a sort of homage or worship to certain stones, trees, and living creatures, in which they assumed that they lived. Some beings were held to be friendly and others unfriendly and it was thought that gifts or offerings would secure the continuance of the friendship of the former and avert the hostility of the latter. Friendly beings gradually became gods, and unfriendly ones were classed as devils, and in the ceremonies which the Egyptian savage performed in their honour, and in the incantations which he recited, the magic of Egypt, the forerunner of her religion, had its origin. The chief object of the savage Egyptian was self-preservation, and self-interest was the mainspring of his actions, all of which were undertaken with a view to material benefits. When he first becomes known to us in the late Neolithic Period we find that he possessed a belief in an existence beyond the grave, and that it was of a material character is proved by the fact that he placed offerings of food in the E19 To prevent their return to this',\n",

We have also shown that a pan or company of gods did not necessarily contain nine deities only, and that it as often as not was supposed to include more than nine gods. Originally, however, the Heliopolitan priests, or the authors of the theological system exhibited in the Pyramid Texts, intended the paut to The Oldest Company of the Gods. Consist Of nine gods, and it seems that they arrived at this decision as the result of the addition of their own local god Tem to a group of four pairs of deities, four gods and four goddesses, whom they had grouped together according to the plan followed by an older school of theologians informing an older company of the gods. The company of the gods last mentioned is probably the oldest of all the companies in Egypt, although for various reasons it never seems to have attained to the popularity of the great paut of the gods of Annu, or to have enjoyed such a prominent position in the minds of the religious philosophers of Egypt. This is not to be wondered at, for whilst the Heliopolitan company of the gods included the Sun-god Ra-Tem, or Ra-Tem-Khepera, and Osiris,',\n",

Finally must be mentioned Ptah in his connexion with the primeval god TENEN, MAMAﬁ, or TA-TU-NEN, 3°S“?,ﬁ, or TA-THUNEN, lli, or TA-THU-NENET, g. lK vmG This god is represented in the form of a man either sitting or standing, who wears on his head the crown and holds in his hands 'the symbols of sovereignty and dominion, A,T, and 1 ; in a figure reproduced by Lanzone1 we see him seated upon the oval object, cza. Another figure represents the god seated with a potter's wheel before him, which he works with his foot, and on the upper part of it is the egg of the world which he is fashioning with his hands; elsewhere he is depicted with a scimitar in his right hand, which suggests that in one form he was regarded as a destructive power of nature, or as a warrior-god . Tenen, or Ta-Tenen, must have been one of the earliest gods of Lower Egypt, and have been a personification of a nature power, the exact attributes of which appear to have been unknown even to the Egyptians. In the early part of the dynastic period it was thought that Ptah, the local god of Memphis, might be fittingly identified with Tenen, or Ta-Tenen, and his name was, therefore, joined to that of the older god, just as in later days the name of Amen was joined to that of Ra; later Tenen and Ta-tenen were merely forms and names of Ptah. From a hymn to Ptah-Tenen, which is probably a product of the XXth or XXIst Dynasty, we may gain some Op.cit., pl.401, No.3. For the hieratic text see Lepsius, Denkmaler, vi., pl.118.\",\n",

Moreover, it is certain that the religious texts in use for funeral purposes under that dynasty are substantially those which were compiled several centuries before. We may note in passing that the funeral books were edited by the priests of Annu or Anu, i.e., Heliopolis, and as a result they exhibit traces of the influence of the theological opinions of the great priestly college of that city; but at bottom the views and beliefs which may be deduced from them, and the fundamental conceptions to which they give expression are the products of the minds of the predynastic, indigenous Egyptians. To the consideration of the Heliopolitan religious system we shall return later, and we may therefore pass on to the enumeration of the principal gods who are made known to us by the Pyramid Texts at Sakkara. Among the great gods who were certainly worshipped in the early archaic period may be mentioned Ptah, Heru, or Horus, Kheper, Net, or Neith, Kheprer, Sebek, Khnemu, Het-Heru (Hathor). Of these gods Heru, or Horus, was the hawk-god, i.e., the spirit and personification of the height of heaven; Kheper was the beetle-god; Khnemu the ram-god; and Sebek the crocodile god; Net or Neith was originally a wood-spirit, Ra and Ptah were two forms of the Sun-god, and Nu was the watery mass of heaven.',\n",

If we think for a moment we shall see that many of the gods of Egypt are closely connected with this stage of development, and that comparatively few of them were ever represented wholly in man\\'s form. The Egyptians clung to their representations of gods in animal form with great tenacity, and even in times when it is certain they cannot have believed in their existence. they continued to have them sculptured and painted upon the walls of their temples. Curiously enough, they do not seem to have been sensible of the ridicule which their conservatism brought down upon them from strangers. We have already said above that the common word given by the Egyptians to God, and god, and spirits of every kind, and beings of all sorts, and kinds, and forms, which were supposed to possess any superhuman or supernatural power, was NETER, and the hieroglyph which is used both as the determinative of this word and also as an ideograph is E].

Whether they were in animal or human form or whether they represented the spirits which concerned themselves with the welfare of men or those which occupied themselves with the direction of the operations of Nature. We see, moreover, from the nome-standards that several objects besides animals were worshipped and regarded as gods, or that they, at all events, became the symbols of the deities which were worshipped in them. In predynastic times we know that some standards were surmounted by representations of two, three, four, or five hills, 1 am, am, M, another by two arrows (P), another by a fish, fin, another by two arrows and a shield, $3, etc. With the predynastic '\\uf0b7 llis probably to be compared the dynastic sign and with the predynastic the dynastic Sign E. It is not easy at present to find a dynastic equivalent for the two arrows (P) or to find the reason why the three hills were connected with a god, but we shall probably be correct if we connect the two arrows with some aboriginal god of war, and the three hills with the abode of some, at present, unknown god. The shield and the crossed arrows can, we think, be explained with more certainty. We know from the Nome Lists that the fifth nome of Lower Egypt, $35, which was called Sapiby the Egyptians and Saltes by the Greeks, had for its capital the city Saut or Sais, and that the great deity of this city was the goddess Nit or Neith. The dynastic pictures of this goddess represent her in the form of a goddess who holds in her hands two arrows and a bow; she sometimes wears upon her head the crown of the north or >o<, which is the Sign for her name, or two crossed arrows in fact, such pictures prove beyond a doubt that Nit, the goddess of Sais, was the goddess of the chase par excellence.

The reading 'Seshet' has also been proposed for the hieroglyphic sign, which forms the symbol of this goddess, but both readings are merely guesses, for the phonetic value of the sign has not yet been ascertained, and even the sign itself has not been identified. All that is certain about it is that in some pictures of the goddess the sign seems to be compounded of a pair of horns inverted over a seven-rayed star, or flower with seven petals, supported on a standard. Dr. Brugsch believed that Sefkhet-aabut was the correct reading of the name, and that it either meant, 'she who has inverted her horns,' or 'she who is provided with seven horns,' the latter meaning being suggested by the similarity of the first part of the name Sefkhet with the ordinary word for 'seven.' From the pictures of the goddess and the titles which accompany them it is quite certain what her functions were. We see her wearing her characteristic symbols on her head, with a close-fitting panther skin garment upon her body, and in her hands she holds a scribe's palette and writing reed; in this form she is called 'the great one, the lady of the house of books.' Thus she was a goddess of literature and the library. Elsewhere we see her without her panther skin garment, holding a writing reed in the right hand, and the cartouche, symbolic of 'name,' in her left; in this form she suggests the idea of being a kind of recording angel, not so much of the deeds committed by man, but of their names, of which she, presumably, took note, that her associate Thoth might declare them before Osiris. In the title which accompanies this pictures she is called great one, lady of letters, mistress of the house of books. In another scene she holds a notched palm branch in her hand, and she appears to be counting the notches; the lower end of the branch rests on the back of a frog.\",\n",

An attempt was made some years ago to include the Book of the Dead among the \"Books of Thoth,\" but it is now quite certain that, although Thoth was declared to have written some of its Chapters, it must be regarded as an entirely separate work and as one which enjoyed a much greater reputation than they. How Thoth was able to perform all the various duties which were assigned to him by the ancients it is difficult to understand, until we remember that according to the Egyptian texts he was the heart, i.e., the mind, and reason, and understanding of the god Ra. The title given to him in some inscriptions, (ER threetimes great, great, from , which the Greeks derived their appellation of the god6rpwpe’ ywros, or ter maximus,\" has not yet been satisfactorily explained, and at present the exact meaning which the Egyptians assigned to it is unknown. It is, however, quite clear that Thoth held in their minds a position which was quite different from that of any other god, and that the attributes which they ascribed to him were unlike the greater number of those of any member of their companies of the gods. The character of Thoth is a lofty and a beautiful conception, and is, perhaps, the highest idea of deity ever fashioned in the Egyptian mind, which, as we have already seen, was somewhat prone to dwell on the material side of divine matters. Thoth, however, as the personification of the mind of God, and as the all-pervading, and governing, and directing power of heaven and of earth, forms a feature of the Egyptian religion which is as sublime as the belief in the resurrection of the dead in a spiritual body, and as the doctrine of everlasting life. Anumber of valuable facts have been collected on the subject generally by Pietschmann, in his Hermes Trismegistus, nach aegyptischen, griechischen und orientalischen Ueberliefnngen, 1875.',\n",

The accounts of the battles of dynastic times show that the Egyptians looted and destroyed the cities and towns of the vanquished, and that they cut down orchards and gardens, and carried off all the flocks and herds which they could find; and there is abundant proof that they mutilated the bodies of their dead foes after a fight, but that they either ate them or behaved towards them in a manner contrary to nature there is absolutely no evidence to show. We have now to consider the remaining paragraphs of the extract from the text of Unas. The god upon whose bodies Unas fed were snared by Am-kehuu, and they were examined as to their fitness and condition by Tcheser-tep-f, a divine being who was in later times one of the Forty-Two Judges in the Hall of Maati, and is mentioned in the \"Negative Confession of the Book of the Dead. The gods were next bound by Her-thertu, and the god Khensu cut their throats and took out their intestines; a being called Shesemu acted as butcher and cut them up and cooked the pieces thereof in his fiery cauldrons. Thereupon Unas ate them, and in eating them he also ate their words of power and their spirits. The largest and finest of the gods he ate at daybreak, and the smaller sized ones for meals at sunset, and the smallest for his meals in the night; the old and worn-out gods he rejected entirely and used them up as fuel in his furnace. The cauldrons in which the bodies of the gods were cooked were heated by the \"Great One in heaven, who shot flame under those which contained the thighs of the oldest of the gods; and the \"Perer, who is in heaven,\" of Unas cast also into cauldrons the thighs of their women. Unas is then said to make a journey about every part of the double sky, or double heaven, i.e., the night sky and the day sky, and also to travel about, presumably from one end to the other, through the two atebu, of Egypt, i.e., the land which lies between the mountains and the Nile on each side of the river. As a result of eating of the bodies of the gods Unas becomes the Great Sekhem, the Sekhem of the Sekhemu; he also becomes the Ashem of Ashem, the Great Ashem of the Ashemu.

The second serpent is the constellation Shetu, i.e., the Tortoise, and its soul appears in human form on its back as soon as Ra addresses it, but when the words have ceased like Temu it disappears into its body. The duty of Shetu was to emit life for Ra every day. Before these march Khnemu and ten gods, ﬁve of whom have no arms; from the neck of one of these project the heads of two serpents. From the descriptive text we learn that the souls of these gods lived on the hidden light of Ra; that the breath of his mouth gave them life, and that their souls fed upon the provisions which were stored in his boat their chief duty was to be with and in attendance upon the god. Besides these gods we also have in this Hour four goddesses, each of whom sits upon the bodies of two uraei, which are bent upwards in such a way as to form a seat the heads of each pair of uraei are reared up in front of the knees of the goddess, who is sitting on their backs, and whose feet rest upon their necks.

He has usually been regarded as a form of the Sun-god, and as the personification of the rising sun, either at the time when it begins to rise above the horizon or immediately after it has risen. The name has often been explained to mean 'Opener,' and to be derived from a root which was cognate in meaning with the well-known Semitic root 'pathah.' In fact, Ptah was thought to be the 'Opener' of the day just as Tem was considered to be the 'Closer of the day. The chief drawback, however, to the acceptance of this derivation is the fact that Ptah never forms one of the groups of the chief forms of the Sun-god in the texts, and his attributes are entirely different from those of Khepera, Tem, Heru, and Ra. Moreover, although the word ptah is found in Egyptian it never has the meaning 'to open,' in the sense of opening a door, and the determinative which follows it proves conclusively that although it does mean 'to open' it is always in the sense of 'to engrave, to carve, to chisel, and the like; compare Heb. 'engraving, sculpture.' The meaning proposed for the name 'Ptah' by Dr. Brugsch is 'sculptor, engraver,' and many passages in the texts of all periods make it plain that Ptah was the chief god of all handicraftsmen.\",\n",

In certain aspects the god had a funeral character which somewhat resembled that of Ptah-Seker-Asar, although he is not mentioned in the Theban Recension of the Book of the Dead. In the Ritual of Embalmment it is said to the deceased, 'Thy soul uniteth itself to I-em-hetep whilst thou art in the funeral valley, and thy heart rejoiceth because thou dost not go into the dwelling of Sebek, and because thou art like a son in the house of his father, and doest what pleaseth thee in the city of Uast (Thebes). The oldest shrine of the god was situated close to the city of Memphis, and was called the Temple of I-em-hetep, the son of Ptah, to which the Greeks gave the name. It stood well outside the city, and lay quite near the Serapeum, on the edge of that portion of the desert which formed the necropolis of the city. Under the Ptolemies a small temple was built in honour of I-em-hetep on the Island of Philae; the hieroglyphic inscriptions are those of Ptolemy IV., Philopator, but the Greek text over the door was placed there by the command of Ptolemy V., Epiphanes. From one of the former we learn that the god was entitled, 'Great one, son of Ptah, the creative god, made by Thenen, begotten by him and beloved by him, the god of divine forms in the temples, who giveth life to all men, the mighty one of wonders, the maker of times who cometh unto him that calleth upon him wheresoever he may be, who giveth sons to the childless, the chief kher-heb (the wisest and most learned one), the image and likeness of Thoth the wise.' I-em-hetep was the god who sent sleep to those who were suffering and in pain, and those who were afflicted with any kind of disease formed his special charge; he was the good physician both of gods and men and he healed the bodies of mortals during life, and superintended the arrangements for the preservation of the same after death.

The worship of Apis is at least as old as the beginning of the dynastic period, and we know that the cult of this bull continued in Memphis until the close of the rule of the Ptolemies. In some way the beliefs concerning Apis were connected with those which the Egyptians held concerning Osiris, the god and judge of the dead, who is called in the Book of the Dead the 'Bull of Amentet,' i.e., the 'Bull of the Underworld,' and in the Ptolemaic period the two gods were merged into one and formed the god Sarapis, to whom were ascribed the attributes of the Egyptian and Greek gods of the Underworld.

Thus in the text of Unas, a king of the Vth Dynasty, we find a series of short magical formulae, many of which are directed against serpents and fierce animals, and all are couched in terms which prove that they must have been composed long before they were inscribed on the walls inside this king's pyramid, and M. Maspero is undoubtedly correct in thinking that they must have presented serious difficulties to the king's literati. In these formulae are mentioned the serpents Ufa, Ex, Nai, Heka, DQM, Hekret, UGO, Setcheh, Tim, Akeneh, Amen, Hau, Antaf, Tcheser-tep, Hemth, Senenahemthet, Qki, and allusions made to a most terrible serpent, EDQ. At the time when these formulae were composed each of these serpents was probably the type of a class of venomous snakes, and their names no doubt described their physical characteristics and their methods of attack. The abject fear of the Egyptians for the serpents seems to have been constant in all generations, and the texts of the latest as well as those of the earliest period contain numerous prayers intended to deliver the deceased from the serpents which are in the Underworld, which live upon the bodies of men and women, and consume their blood.

He is undoubtedly correct in thinking that the use of the stone axe precedes that of the flint arrow-head or flint knife, and many facts could be adduced in support of this view. The stone tied to the end of a stick formed an effective club, which was probably the earliest weapon known to the predynastic Egyptians, and subsequently man found that this weapon could be made more effective still by making the stone flat and by rubbing down one end of it to form a cutting edge. The earliest axe-head had a cutting edge at each end, and was tied by leather thong to the end of a stick by the middle, thus becoming a double axe; examples of such a weapon appear to be given on the green slate object of the archaic period which is preserved in the British Museum1 (Nos. where, however, the axe-heads appear to be fixed in forked wooden handles. In its next form the axe-head has only one cutting edge, and the back of it is shaped for fastening to a handle by means of leather thongs. When we consider the importance that the axe, whether as a weapon or tool, was to primitive man, we need not wonder that it became to him first the symbol of physical force, or strength, and then of divinity or dominion. By means of the axe the predynastic Egyptians cut down trees and slaughtered animals, in other words, the weapon was mightier than the spirits or gods who dwelt in the trees and the animals, and as such became to them at a very early period an object of reverence and devotion. But besides this the axe must have been used in sacrificial ceremonies, where it would necessarily acquire great importance, and would easily pass into the symbol of the ceremonies themselves.

He is disturbed about that which hath happened to the divine children of Nut, for they have done battle, they have upheld strife, they have done evil, they have created the fiends, they have made slaughter, they have caused trouble; in truth, in all their doings the mighty have worked against the weak. And thou regardest not evil, nor art thou provoked to anger when they bring their years to confusion and throng in and push to disturb their months; for in all that they have done unto thee they have worked iniquity in secret. The deceased adds, I am thy writing palette, O Thoth, and I have brought unto thee thine ink-jar, and as he declares that he is not one of those who work iniquity in secret places, at the same time he clearly dissociates himself from those who do. These words are followed by a very remarkable passage in which the deceased, addressing Thoth under the name of Temu, asks the god what the place is into which he has come, and he says that it is without water, that it hath not air, it is depth unfathomable, it is black as the blackest night, and men wander helplessly therein.\",\n",

The lives of the Coptic martyrs show the use which the Egyptian made of his metaphysical spirit, and the history of the early Church in Egypt illustrates what happened when he tried to apply it to the consideration of the common theological terms in Greek and in Latin. Incidentally we may note that in order to express the various ideas connected with the Christian Deity and the Persons of the Trinity he was obliged to take over the actual Greek words into his language, which was poor in abstract ideas. In the picture which M. Maspero has given of the Egyptian’s conception of the universe and of the origin of gods and things he has only dwelt upon the mythological side of the question, and has not set forth all the passages upon which other Egyptologists have based their views about Egyptian monotheism; moreover, no allowance appears to have been made for the peculiar religious and mental characteristics of the race. But when all is said against the Egyptian religion which can be said, the fact remains that it is not the religion itself which has cruel, ridiculous, and indecent dogmas, but the myths wherewith generations of foolish priests obscured the pure beliefs in monotheism and immortality which seem to have existed in Egypt from the earliest times. If modern oriental religions were judged in the adverse manner in which the religion of ancient Egypt has been judged, none would escape similar condemnation the same thing may be said of some of the religions of the Western nations. The superstitions which exist among many Eastern nations professing monotheism and even Christianity are as gross as those found among so-called Pagan nations as examples may be quoted the Christians of St. John in Southern Mesopotamia, and many of the Arabic-speaking peoples of the Eastern Sûdân, yet among the former no one attempts to deny the existence of a sort of Christianity, though he would indeed be bold who would dare to compare it with the Christianity of such men as Canon Liddon or Cardinal Newman; similarly, the monotheism of the peoples of the Eastern Sûdân is universally admitted, but it does not prevent their indulging in the coarsest and most fantastic beliefs and practices.',\n",

The difference between the methods employed in creating gods and men must be noted; the gods are the seed of Khepera, and they came forth from his mouth, whilst men are only the tears of the god, and they came forth from his Eye. The older version makes the tears of Khepera to fall upon his genital organs, and it is only after they have been in contact with the god\\'s virility that they turn into human beings. In late dynastic times the Egyptians divided mankind into four classes, namely, the Egyptians, the Aamu, the Nebesu, and the Themehu.

Of the Nebesu, king the Negroes, Horus says, \"I masturbated for you, and I have been content at the millions who have come forth from me in your name. Nebesu; Horus hath created you, and it is he who hath protected their souls.\" This last statement is of interest, for it connects the idea of masturbation with the Negroes, that is to say, with the dark or black-skinned races of Nubia who lived on the banks of the Nile 1See Bonomi and Sharpe, Sarcophagus of Oimenepthah, p11.7 and 6D.

She represented not only what was true, but what was good, and all that is best in woman as wife, mother, and daughter; she was also the patron goddess of all singers, dancers, and merry-makers of every kind, of beautiful women, and of love, of artists and artistic works, and also of the vine and wine, and ale and beer, and, in fact, of joy and happiness, and of everything which contributed thereto. She was identified with Sothis, which was called the second sun in heaven, she was thereby connected with the rise of the Nile preparatory to the Inundation, and she appeared in the form of this star in the heavens in the neighborhood of the sun in the second half of July. Sothis rose heliacally on the first day of the Egyptian New Year, and when the Sun-god Ra had entered his boat, Hathor, the goddess of the star Sothis, went with him and took up her place like a crown upon his forehead. She was, as we have seen, both the wife of Ra, and the daughter of Ra; she herself was brought forth by the goddess Nut in the form of a black-skinned, or blackish-red-skinned child and received as her name that of the last hour of the day, Khnemet ankh, or Hathor, as lady of the Underworld, played a very prominent part in connection with the welfare of the dead, for without her friendly help and protection the deceased could never attain to everlasting life.

In his hymn to Ra the deceased officer Nekht says, 'O thou beautiful being, thou dost renew thyself in thy season in the form of the Disk within thy mother Hathor,' with which words he refers to the goddess as a nature power.

They may be due either to the imagination of the Egyptians, which conceived of the existence of quadrupeds wherein were united the strength of one animal and the wisdom or cunning of another, e.g., the Setchawhich united with itself the strength of the leopard with the cunning of the serpent, and the nameless leopard with a man’s winged head, or to the ignorance of the ancients of natural history. The human head on an animal represented the intelligence of a man, and the wings the swift flight of the bird, and the body of the leopard the strength and the lithe motions of that animal. In conceiving the existence of such creatures the imagination may have been assisted in its fabrication of fabulous monsters by legends or stories of pre-dynastic animals which were current in certain parts of Egypt during the dynastic period. Thus, as we have said before, the monster serpents of Egyptian mythology have their prototypes in the huge serpents which lived in the country in primeval times, and there is no doubt that Apep was, originally, nothing more than A fabulous leopard, a huge serpent which lived in some mountain on the western bank of the Nile. On the other hand, it is possible that the Egyptians really believed in the existence of composite animals, and that they never understood the impossibility of the head and neck of a serpent growing out of the body of a lion, or the head The animal Shoo.',\n",

Although it is customary nowadays to base the story of the slaying of Argos on a misunderstanding of Hermes' title, which seems really to mean 'white-gleaming,' it would probably be nearer the truth to base it on a folk-belief in an earth-born monster, who, under the control of Hermes, stood guard over souls in the lower world. The Functions of Hermes. - Hermes is best known as the conductor of departed souls to Hades, and, conversely, he could also release them from the world below. Through the discharge of these duties he first of all became connected with necromancy, or conjuring of the dead, and later, in consequence of the popular classification of dream-oracles as necromantic, he was evolved into a god of sleep and of dreams, developing, in the end, out and out into a deity of magic. As the souls of the dead could be magically committed to him as they traversed the highway between the two worlds, so too could the souls of the living be guarded by him as they went their way to and fro upon earth. Hence the images of Hermes at cross-roads were believed to avert evil from travellers, and here one can see the logic of his frequent association with Apollo, Artemis, and Hekate. As god of the high road it was natural to suppose that he himself was immune from the perils of the way; he could, therefore, exercise the double duty of protecting heralds, the most sacred travellers among men, and of himself being the inviolate herald of the gods; and thus he was an important figure in the early stages of international law. Since the herald must have a fluent and persuasive tongue, Hermes became the god of oratory and speech in general. No one journeys as much as he who travels for gain, and hence Hermes\",\n",

Acting as priest, Prometheus sacrificed an ox and divided it into two parts, one of which consisted of flesh and other edible portions enveloped in the skin of the animal, while the second was composed of bones and entrails alluringly garnished with strips of rich fat. It was the hope of Prometheus that Zeus would be misled by appearances and choose the poorer part, but to the Olympian the deceit was too plain, and, in order that he might have an excuse for punishing men, he deliberately took the bones and entrails, and withheld the gift of fire from men. Moved with pity, Prometheus stole some embers and brought them to mankind hidden in a hollow stalk. In some myths it is said that he took the fire from the very hearth of Zeus; in others, from the workshop of Hephaistos and Athene on Lemnos; in still others, from the fiery chariot of the sun. Through this sublime theft men were enabled to lift the ban of Zeus, to begin life anew, and little by little to evolve arts and crafts. But Prometheus paid the penalty for his trespass on the divine rights of Zeus to the exclusive control of fire. Zeus had him chained to a crag (or pillar) in the range of Caucasus and appointed an eagle to gnaw at his vitals, consuming each day what had been restored during the night just past. Despite his many sufferings the spirit of Prometheus was unquenched, for he was comforted with the foreknowledge that someday he would be released and that Zeus would be overthrown even as Ouranos and Kronos had fallen. In due time his shackles were broken by Herakles and he was brought back to Olympos to serve his fellow-gods with his gift of prophecy. In one odd version of the story the rocks sank with Prometheus into the gloomy depths of Tartaros. The notion that man was shaped from clay was relatively late. By the fifth century B.C. the belief in this process was general, and by the fourth it was the rule to identify Prometheus as the artist. From clay he fashioned both men and beasts and into them passed emanations of the divine fire which',\n",

From that time onward it was customary to utter imprecations when sacrificing to Herakles. Wandering across Arabia and Lydia, he chanced to come to the place where the unhappy Prometheus was chained. Moved with pity, he shot the bird that was tormenting him, unbound his fetters, and with the permission of Zeus gave him Cheiron's eternal immunity from death. At last he reached the end of his weary journey, the land of the Hyperboreians where Atlas stood bearing the heavens on his shoulders. With little more ado Herakles killed the dragon, plucked the apples, and conveyed them to Eurystheus, but as they were too divine for mortal keeping, they were later restored to the Hesperides. Another version of this legend, in which Atlas is beguiled to accomplish the theft, is inconsistent with the character of the traditional Herakles. Twelfth Labour. One realm of nature was as yet unconquered by Herakles—the underworld and thither he was sent on his last mission to fetch Kerberos, the hell-hound with three heads and the tail of a serpent, and out of whose body grew a writhing tangle of snakes. On his way to Tainaron in Lakonia, the most spacious entry to the lower world, Herakles halted at Eleusis, and, as soon as Eumolpos had purified him of the blood of the Centaurs, he was initiated into the mysteries. Once at the cave of Tainaron, he descended and found among the shades those of many whom he had known in the world above. Though the place was entirely strange to him, he could not be daunted from continuing his deeds of chivalry. He released Theseus from the bonds which Hades had thrown upon him, overpowered Menoites, the herdsman of Hades' kine, until Persephone had to beg for him to be spared, and, killing one of the cattle, he shed its blood to gratify the gibbering shades.

Though affirming the immateriality of souls, they were unable to conceive of their conscious existence without at least some of the accessories of the material. After death a man's shade pursued the same occupations which it had followed in life and cherished the same characteristic passions. Orion still hunted the wild beasts of the woodland; Aias still harboured his anger against Achilles; Aiakos and Rhadamanthys still sat on the tribunals of judgement; Teiresias still dispensed his prophecies. This bondage to the material extended even to the punishments of the arch-criminals: Ixion was bound to a real wheel, and Sisyphos struggled with a real stone. When the Greeks came to localize the abode of the assembled shades, they not unnaturally, like many other peoples, believed it to be under the earth, an idea which probably sprang from the primitive custom of burial; and after the belief had once been established, it was easy to think of those souls that had been banished from their bodies by cremation as going to the same place. In this underworld were gathered the souls of all except a special few, souls that were thenceforth like to pale flocks fallen as leaves, Folds of dead people, and alien from the sun. It was a spacious democratic realm in which they abode, a realm in which there was no fear of overcrowding. Its boundaries were impassable, and rarely did a soul return from it to the upper light, even for a brief season. It was a kingdom organized like a kingdom of earth; Hades and Persephone sat on its two thrones as king and queen; and it had its several benches of judges.

We have dwelt thus long on the nature and function of art in order the more Clearly to reveal the relation of Greek myth to Greek religion. The religious material of most of the myths which have come down to us was simply crass superstition, but, taken over by devout and inspired bards, it was passed at the white heat of emotion through the refining pot of their spirits and came out transformed as poetry. Later Homer appeared. With his superior gifts he fused this poetry and a number of crude superstitions into the noble epics that are attributed to his name. This gave the needed impulse to a long succession of lesser poets. The gods and heroes of Homer were common property and had a remoteness from the life interests of the bards\\' own local communities which gave them, as it were, a licence for moulding them as they could not mould their local gods and heroes. The painter and the sculptor followed in their steps. Imitating, as they did, idealizing and relatively refined models, they could not themselves but represent the ideal and the refined. This is the reason why the gross elements of the myths and popular superstitions rarely thrust themselves into the higher sculpture, and with but little more frequency into vase-painting, the least noble of the Greek arts. 10. Methods of Interpreting Myth. A citation of the most important methods of interpreting myths, with brief comment, is sufficient for the purposes of this volume. I. The natural method. Followers of this system would trace practically every legend back to a primitive account of some natural phenomenon or group of phenomena. According to them myths are solar, lunar, or astral; or are to be referred to light, the winds, clouds, rain, vegetation, and so forth. 2. The philological method.

At this time Carthage was ruled by a Tyrian queen named Dido, who welcomed the fugitives into her court, entertaining them for many months as though they were a company of kings, and at her request Aeneas told the story of the fall of his city and of his perilous voyage from land to land in his search for a home. His personal charms won her love, and she offered to share her kingdom with him, but when, weary of wandering longer and despairing of finding his destined land, Aeneas was on the point of yielding to her passionate importunities, Jupiter, through Mercury, roused him from his lethargy and turned his face once more toward the ships and the sea.

For this base ingratitude he called down bitter curses on their heads from which they were thenceforward to suffer; for the curses of parents on children were the direst of all. With the faithful Antigone he went to Kolonos in Attike, where he became a suppliant at the Shrine of the Eumenides, the avenging spirits of the dead.

She has no place as yet in the group of the Olympians, nor has She any part to play in the action of either Iliad or Odyssey. Homer is not acquainted with her as the mother of Persephone, and the story of her amour with Iasion as related in the epic will be referred to under the next heading. Demeter as the Goddess of the Soil. The nature of Demeter is brought out by an admittedly ancient myth found both in Homer and in Hesiod, the latter’s account being richer in details. \"Demeter, divine one of goddesses, mingling in love with the hero Iasion in a thrice-ploughed fallow field in the fat land of Crete, bore Ploutos, a goodly son who goeth everywhere upon earth and upon the broad ridges of the sea. Whatsoever man he meeteth and into whose hands he cometh doth he make rich, and to him doth he vouchsafe abundant happiness.\" Homer adds that when Zeus learned of the deed of Iasion, he smote him dead with a thunderbolt.

Though the bounty of Demeter comprehended every product of the soil which was of use to men, the cereal fruits came to be regarded as the special objects of her care. All operations on the farm, all parts of the farm, such as barn and field and so forth, which had to do with the cultivation of the grain, the crops in all stages of their growth, the cut grain in the sheaf and on the threshing-floor, all these things too came under her surveillance.

According to Homer, the sun spent the hours of darkness near her so that at his appointed time She could call forth his gleaming chariot. It was She who roused the breeze of morning and sprayed the grass with refreshing dew. Sometimes, like the sun, She was conceived as riding in a car drawn by two or by four horses, but often she was thought to move by running, or by flying with wings growing from her shoulders and feet. She is commonly represented in art as winged and with her hair streaming behind her as she speeds forward. EOS was uniformly the daughter of Hyperion, and, therefore, the sister of Helios and Selene. She had a notorious penchant for beautiful young hunters, for example, Kephalos and Orion, and another of her lovers was Tithonos, a brother of Priam of Troy. Enamoured of his beauty, she carried him off in her chariot to the land of the Aithiopians, and, inasmuch as she was a mere mortal, she besought Zeus to grant him endless life. Zeus granted her request, but She had forgotten to ask also for the boon of eternal youth, so that, after many years, Tithonos wasted away with the steady advance of old age, and became only a burden to himself and to Eos. To get him out of the way she enclosed him in a room from which only the faint cry of his voice could emerge, and finally, to end his misery, she changed him into a cicada. Their children were Memnon, who fell at Troy, Emathion, and Hemera. It is customary to account for Tithonos as the regular return, the waxing, and the waning of the day, and to explain Memnon, the dusky Aithiopian, as the darkness between evening twilight and the dawn, while Emathion and Hemera are masculine and feminine conceptions of the day.

In a certain sense, then, the tradition is correct which places him three generations before the Trojan war; he is not far from being a historical character. Minos is chiefly known as a ruler of powerful initiative in many fields. He founded numerous cities in Crete, the most notable being his capital, Knossos; to facilitate the administration of government he divided the island into three districts with Knossos, Phaistos, and Kydonia as head cities; and he extended his sway far out over the islands and the coasts of the mainland, and many settlements were named after him. He divided the Cretan burghers into two main classes, farmers and soldiers—producers and defenders; with the assistance of the people of Karia he is said to have cleared the sea of pirates; and to enable his citizens to develop their maritime commerce he invented a type of small coasting vessel. The code of laws which he established among the Cretans he received in the first place from Zeus, and, in order to obtain advice with reference to such modifications of it as should be necessary from time to time, he went to Mount Ida every ninth year and conferred with Zeus. In his administration of the law his brother Rhadamanthys assisted him in the cities, and Talos, the man of bronze, in the country, but Rhadamanthys succeeded only too well, so that he incurred the jealousy of Minos and was banished to a remote part of the island. As a warrior Minos showed himself cruel and harsh and in conflict with his character as a just and mild ruler, although this side of his portrait is, no doubt, coloured by Athenian prejudice. His career in arms will be narrated in the myths of Attike. Daidalos.—Though a native of Athens, Daidalos is more closely connected with the legends of Crete than with those of Attike.

For Hera darted from Olympos' peak, and came swiftly to Achaian Argos, where she knew was the stately wife Of Sthenelos the son Of Perseus, who also was great with child, and her seventh month was come. Her son Hera brought to the light, though his tale of months was untold, but she stayed Alkmene's bearing and kept the Eileithyia if from her aid.

Many children were born to Zeus and Hera, and they were the first to be properly called gods. They established themselves on Mount Olympos, which stood directly opposite Mount Othrys, the seat of the Titans, who, being the older race (with the exception of Mnemosyne, Themis, and Prometheus), quite naturally regarded Zeus and his family as upstarts and usurpers. Bitter rivalry and strife arose between the two settlements, and for ten years they fought with no decisive results. A peace-parley held at the end of this period seemed only to add heat to the conflict, so that at length Zeus freed the three hundred-handed Giants whom Kronos had left bound deep down within the earth, and enlisted them in his ranks, deciding now to reveal his full strength and to bring the tedious strife to a sudden end.

Pandora, we remember, was moulded by his hand out of clay, and a hint of this function may also be read in the account of his strange fathering of Erichthonios in union with Athene. Invocations supported by magical rites were often addressed to him to bring fertility to barren women. Hephaistos in Art. The artists consistently represented Hephaistos as a smith holding a hammer. Many statues of the sixth century grossly caricatured his lameness, but others merely hinted at it or almost entirely suppressed it. In the late period he became a rare theme of art, and where he was represented at all it was as the serious artisan. HESTIA The Origin and the Name of Hestia. Hestia undoubtedly belonged to an old stratum of Greek life, and unlike most of the other gods She was herself the object for which her name stood—the hearth for that she was not the fire, nor the spirit of the fire burning on the hearth, is clear from the lack of daemonic characteristics in her person. As the hearth itself she was originally a product of the preanimistic stage of thought, and from this stage she never advanced far, a circumstance which was due to her static nature. The other gods could exercise their activities over broad ranges of territory and peoples, but her virtue would have vanished with movement, and, like home-keeping youths, she had homely wits. Her importance rested on the imperative need of fire in the primitive home and in the immense difficulty of procuring it in event of sudden demand. The Genealogy and Functions of Hestia.

When she was nearing womanhood her parents sent her to Delphoi to inquire of the oracle concerning her marriage. One day, while the response was being awaited, she happened to be dancing in the temple of Artemis at Sparta, when Theseus of Athens and his friend Peirithoos suddenly appeared and seized her. The two drew lots for her possession, and she was given to Theseus, who carried her off to Attike and left her in charge of his mother Aithra in the mountain village of Aphidnai. Helen’s brothers, Kastor and Polydeukes, thinking that she was at Athens, went thither and demanded her release, only to meet with refusal. Not long afterward, however, when Theseus departed for a distant country, the brothers learned of the place of Helen’s concealment and by a sudden attack succeeded in carrying her home along with her custodian Aithra. The Citizens of Athens, alarmed at the military demonstration of Kastor and Polydeukes, admitted them into their city and thereafter accorded them divine honours. This myth we can probably put down as a fiction to account both for an early clash between Athens and Sparta and for the introduction of the worship of Kastor and Polydeukes into the City first named.

The most that one can say of the origin of Athene is that she belonged to the so-called Achaian period and was worshipped by Dorian and Ionian alike, while her cult was diffused uniformly over the entire Greek world. No observable traces of a Pelasgic descent cling to her person, although she may have been Pelasgic. Equally lacking are remarks of her importation from the Orient; this we confidently assert in the face of apparently well-supported statements that she, along with Hera, was an offshoot of the Philistine goddess Assah of Gaza; and her identification at Corinth with the Syro-Arabian goddess Allét was a mere accident. The main lines of her character and the forms of her worship observed, for instance, in Tegea, Sparta, Kyrene, Rhodes, and Athens were all developed primarily in Argos, but of all these places Athens alone added new traits and stimulated the logical unfolding of old ones, so that, for this reason, it is in Athens that we can study Athene to the greatest advantage. AS for the meaning of her name, here again we must confess to ignorance, although one suggested etymology is at least worth consideration. This derives her appellation from c’ t-Hsjviov (“without mother’s milk”) and interprets it either passively or actively, the reference in the former sense being to Athene’s unmothered birth from Zeus and in the latter to her sexless character, which is much like that of the Amazons.

Unfortunately, a narrow shot at them chanced to hit Cheiron, inflicting a wound which Herakles would have healed, had not the pain of it driven the Centaur to exchange his immortality for the mortality of Prometheus and thus voluntarily to die.

Without delay Herakles broke down a large part of the foundations of the stables and through the breach thus made diverted the united waters of the rivers Alpheios and Peneios, thus flushing the filth entirely away.

The people of Epidaurus said that Asklepios was first known as Epios, but after he had healed King Askles of a grievous malady, he assumed the longer and traditional name. In Epidaurus his wife was Epione, but elsewhere she was Lampetie, a daughter of Helios. Machaon, the hero-physician, was always held to be a son of Asklepios and sometimes Epione and Hygieia were said to be his daughters. The serpent is the constant symbol of Asklepios in both legend and worship, the burghers of a certain Epidaurus in Lakonia claiming that their shrine of the god was built on a spot where a snake had disappeared beneath the earth. In his sacred precincts in the Argive Epidaurus, and in those of Athens and Kos, which were offshoots of the former, the serpent was the living emblem of his presence and was thought to communicate means of healing to sufferers from disease as they slept in the holy place, the rite technically known as 'incubation.' Asklepios was invariably attended by groups of priests who devoted themselves to surgery and other curative means, and many extant inscriptions tell of their wonderful successes. In the island of Kos in particular the priests of Asklepios laid the foundations of the modern scientific study and practice of medicine. Depth in Art. Owing to the failure of poetry to attribute any definite traits of face and form to Asklepios, the artists were thrown back upon their own ingenuity. They chose to represent him after the ideal of Zeus, but of milder countenance and of less majestic manner. He is shown seated or standing like the corresponding types of Zeus, though holding the sceptre not as a mark of might but as a staff on which to lean. The best representations of him are seen in the votive offerings of his shrine where incubation (sleep-cure) was practised.\",\n",

ABSTRACT DIVINITIES The same habit of thought which could clothe the mysterious Operations of nature with all the features of personality could consistently treat in like manner the inscrutable processes of the mind and the qualities of things, whence we actually find the Greeks making these abstract conceptions over into divine beings. That this was not merely a late but a very early practice is demonstrated in the evident antiquity of Mnemosyne, Eunomia, and certain others of their kind in Hesiod. This entire class of divinities was treated in myth, when they were given any place at all, in the same way as were the more highly personalized nature-gods, although they were debarred from frequent appearance in this field, for temperamentally the Greeks shrank from the bald literalness of their names, and some of the divinities recorded below are by nature perilously near the concrete. The list is of necessity far from complete and must be regarded as supplying little more than mere illustrations.

To circumvent the prophecy he enclosed his daughter Danaé in a brazen chamber, thinking thereby to cut her off from all human intercourse; but he failed in his purpose; for, as some say, the maiden was corrupted by her uncle Proitos, or, as others claim, by Zeus, who won his way to her in the form of a shower of gold falling through an aperture in the roof of her prison. When she had given birth to a son whom she called Perseus, Akrisios put them both in a chest and sent them adrift on the waters of the Aegean. By wind and wave the chest was carried to Seriphos, where it was dragged ashore by Diktys, the brother of Polydektes, the king of the island, who released Danaé and her child and gave them a home. After a number of years Polydektes made love to Danae but was rejected. Fearing to take her by force, since Perseus was by this time quite capable of defending his mother, he devised a plan to get her son out of the way. To all his friends he sent invitations to a wedding-feast, and Perseus, with the extravagant assertion of youth, replied that he would not fail to be present even if he had to bring the Gorgon’s head. When the guests had assembled and it was discovered that all of them except Perseus had brought horses as presents, Polydektes dismissed him until he should have fulfilled his promise to the letter, warning him, moreover, that in event of failure his mother would be wedded by force. Sadly Perseus withdrew to a lonely spot; but in the midst of his perplexity Hermes and Athene appeared and led him to the Graiai, the ancient daughters of Phorkys and Keto. These had been grey from birth and had amongst them only one eye and one tooth, which they used in turns. By getting possession of these indispensable members and by threatening to keep them, Perseus compelled the Graiai to tell him the way to the dwelling-place of the nymphs who guarded the dog-skin cap of Hades, the winged sandals, and the magic pouch.

It had a large trunk from which numerous   branches extended in all directions. Delightful to look at, the shade it   afforded was very refreshing. It stood in the midst of the forest, and   animals of diverse species lived on it. A mouse of great wisdom, named   Palita, lived at the foot of that tree, having made a hole there with a   hundred outlets. On the branches of the tree there lived a cat, of the   name of Lomasa, in great happiness, daily devouring a large number of   birds. Some time after, a Chandala came into the forest and built a hut   for himself. Every evening after sunset he spread his traps. Indeed,   spreading his nets made of leathern strings he went back to his hut, and   happily passing the night in sleep, returned to the spot at the dawn of   day. Diverse kinds of animals fell into his traps every night. And it so   happened that one day the cat, in a moment of heedlessness, was caught in   the snare. O thou of great wisdom, when his foe the cat who   was at all times an enemy of the mouse species was thus caught in the net, the mouse   Palita  came out of his hole and began to rove about fearlessly. While   trustfully roving through the forest in search of food, the mouse after a   little while saw the meat that the Chandala had spread there as lure.   Getting upon the trap, the little animal began to eat the flesh. Laughing   mentally, he even got upon his enemy entangled helplessly in the net.   Intent on eating the flesh, he did not mark his own danger, for as   he  suddenly cast his eyes he saw a terrible foe of his arrived at that spot.   That foe was none else than a restless mongoose of coppery eyes, of the   name of Harita. Living in underground holes, its body resembled the   flower of a reed. Allured to that spot by the scent of the mouse, the   animal came there with great speed for devouring his prey. And he stood   on his haunches, with head upraised, licking the corners of his mouth   with his tongue. The mouse beheld at the same time another foe living in   the trees, then sitting on the branch of the banian. It was a   night-prowling owl of the name of Chandraka of sharp beaks. Having   become an object of sight with both the mongoose and the owl, the mouse, in   great alarm, began to think in this strain: 'At such a season of great   danger, when death itself is staring me in the face, when there is fear   on every side, how should one act that wishes for one's good? Encompassed   on all sides by danger, seeing fear in every direction, the mouse, filled   with alarm for his safety, made a high resolution. Warding off even   innumerable dangers by hundreds of means, one should always save   one's life. Danger, at the present moment, encompasses me on every side. If I   were to descend from this trap on the ground, without adequate   precautions, the mongoose will surely seize and devour me. If I remain on   this trap, the owl will surely seize me. If, again, that cat succeeds in   disentangling himself from the net, he also is certain to devour me. It   is not proper, however, that a person of our intelligence should lose his   wits. I shall, therefore, strive my best to save my life, aided by proper   means and intelligence. A person possessed of intelligence and wisdom and   conversant with the science of policy never sinks, however great and   terrible the danger that threatens him. At present, however, I do not   behold any other refuge than this cat. He is an enemy. But he is in   distress. The service that I can do him is very great. Sought to be made   a prey by three foes, how should I now act for saving my life? I should   now seek the protection of one of those foes, viz., the cat. Taking the   aid of the science of policy, let me counsel the cat for his good, so   that I may, with my intelligence, escape from all the three. The cat is   my great foe, but the distress into which he has fallen is very great.   Let me try whether I can succeed in making this foolish creature   understand his own interests. Having fallen into such distress, he may   make peace with me. A person when afflicted by a stronger one should make   peace with even an enemy. Professors of the science of policy say that   even this should be the conduct of one who having fallen into distress   seeks the safety of his life. It is better to have a learned person for   an enemy than a fool for a friend. As regards myself, my life now rests   entirely in the hands of my enemy the cat. I shall now address the cat on   the subject of his own liberation. Perhaps, at this moment, it would not   be wrong to take the cat for an intelligent and learned foe.' Even thus   did that mouse, surrounded by foes, pursue his reflections. Having   reflected in this strain, the mouse, conversant with the science of   Profit and well acquainted with occasions when war should be declared   and peace made, gently addressed the cat, saying, 'I address thee in   friendship, O cat! Art thou alive? I wish thee to live! I   desire the good of us both. O amiable one, thou hast no cause for fear. Thou shalt live   in happiness. I shall rescue thee, if, indeed, thou dost not slay me.   There is an excellent expedient in this case, which suggests itself to   me, and by which you may obtain your escape and I may obtain great   benefit. By reflecting earnestly I have hit upon that expedient for thy   sake and for my sake, for it will benefit both of us. There are the   mongoose and the owl, both waiting with evil intent. Only so long, O cat,   as they do not attack me, is my life safe. There that wretched owl with   restless glances and horrid cries is eyeing me from the branch of the   tree. I am exceedingly frightened by it. Friendship, as regards the good,   is seven-paced. Possessed of wisdom as thou art, thou art my friend.   I shall act towards thee as a friend. Thou needst have no fear now.   Without my help, O cat, thou wilt not succeed in tearing the net. I,   however, shall cut the net for serving thee, if thou abstain from killing   me. Thou hast lived on this tree and I have lived at its foot. Both of us   have dwelt here for many long years. All this is known to   thee. He upon whom nobody places his trust, and he who never trusts another, are never   applauded by the wise. Both of them   are unhappy. For this reason, let our   love for each other increase, and let there be union amongst us two. Men   of wisdom never applaud the endeavour to do an act when its opportunity   has passed away. Know that this is the proper time for such an   understanding amongst us. I wish that thou shouldst live, and thou also   wishest that I should live. A man crosses a deep and   large river by a   piece of wood. It is seen that the man takes the piece of wood to the   other side, and the piece of wood also takes the man to the other side.   Like this, our compact, also will bring happiness to both of us. I will   rescue thee, and thou also will rescue me.' Having said these words that   were beneficial to both of them, that were fraught with reason and on   that account highly acceptable, the mouse Palita waited in expectation of   an answer.\",\n",

Behold how the ground is studded with places for the sacrificial fires of various forms, and how the earth seems to be subsiding here under the pressure of Yayati's pious works. This is the Sami tree, which hath got but a single leaf, and this is a most excellent lake. Behold these lakes of Parasurama, and the hermitage of Narayana. O protector of earth! This is the path which was followed by Richika's son, of unmeasured energy, who roamed over the earth, practising the Yoga rites in the river Raupya. And, O delight of the tribe of Kurus! Hear what a Pisacha woman (she-goblin), who was decked with pestles for her ornaments, said (to a Brahmana woman), as I was reciting here the table of genealogy. (She said), 'Having eaten curd in Yugandhara, and lived in Achutasthala, and also bathed in Bhutilaya, thou shouldst live with thy sons. Having passed a single night here, if thou wilt spend the second, the events of the night will be different from those that have happened to thee in the day-time, O most righteous of Bharata's race! Today we shall spend the night at this very spot. O scion of Bharata's race! this is the threshold of the field of the Kurus. O king! At this very spot, the monarch Yayati, son of Nahusha, performed sacrificial rites, and made gifts of an abundance of gems. And Indra was pleased with those sacred rites. This is an excellent holy bathing-place on the river Yamuna, known as Plakshavatarana (descent of the banian tree). Men of cultured minds call it the entrance to the region of heaven. O respected sir! here, after having performed sacrificial rites of the Saraswata king, and making use of the sacrificial stake for their pestle, the highest order of saints performed the holy plunge prescribed at the end of a sacred ceremony. O monarch! King Bharata here performed sacrificial rites. To celebrate the horse-sacrifice, he here set free the horse who was the intended victim. That monarch had won the sovereignty of the earth by righteousness. The horse he let go more than once were of a colour checkered with black. O tiger among men! it was here that Marutta sheltered by Samvartta, leader of saints, succeeded in performing excellent sacrifices. O sovereign of kings! Having taken his bath at this spot, one can behold all the worlds, and is purified from his evil deeds. Do thou, therefore, bathe at this spot.' Vaisampayana said, 'Then that most praiseworthy of Pandu's sons, there bathed with his brothers, while the mighty saints were uttering laudatory words to him. And he addressed the following words to Lomasa, 'O thou whose strength lieth in truthfulness! By virtue of this pious act, I behold all the worlds. And from this place, I behold that most praiseworthy of Pandu's sons Arjuna, the rider of white steed.' 'Lomasa said, 'It is even so, O thou of powerful arms! The saints of the highest order thus behold all the regions. Behold this holy Saraswati here, thronged by persons who look upon her as their sole refuge. O most praise worthy of men! having bathed here, thou wilt be free from all thy sins. O Kunti's son! here the celestial saints performed sacrificial rites of Saraswata king: and so did the saints and the royal saints. This is the altar of the lord of beings, five yojanas in extent on all sides round. And this is the field of the magnanimous Kurus, whose habit it was to perform sacrifices.' SECTION CXXX 'Lomasa said, 'O son of Bharata's race! If mortals breathe their last at this spot, they go to heaven. O king! Thousands upon thousands of men come to this place to die. A blessing was pronounced on this spot by Daksha, when he was engaged in sacrifice here, (in these words), 'Those men that shall die at this spot shall win a place in heaven.' Here is the beautiful and sacred river, Saraswati, full of water: and here, O lord of men, is the spot known as Vinasana, or the place where the Saraswati disappeared. Here is the gate of the kingdom of the Nishadas and it is from hatred for them that the Saraswati entered into the earth in order that the Nishadas might not see her. Here too is the sacred region of Chamashodbheda where the Saraswati once more became visible to them. And here she is joined by other sacred rivers running seawards. O conqueror of foes, here is that sacred spot known by the name of Sindhu --where Lopamudra accepted the great sage Agastya as her lord and, O thou whose effulgence is like unto that of the sun, here is the sacred tirtha called Prabhasa, the favoured spot of Indra and which removeth\",\n",

       " {'text': \"adoreth the goddess Sandhya in the morning and the evening, and who recites meditatively the sacred goddess Gayatri who is the mother of the Vedas, sanctified by the latter, is freed from all his sins. Even if he accepts in gift the entire earth with her oceans, he doth not, on that account, suffer the least unhappiness. And those heavenly bodies in the sky including the sun that may be inauspicious and hostile towards him soon become auspicious and favourable towards him in consequence of these acts of his, while those stars that are auspicious and favourable become more auspicious and more favourable in consequence of such conduct of his. And terrible Rakshasas subsisting on animal food, or gigantic and fierce mien, all become unable to prevail over a Brahmana who practiseth these purifications. The Brahmanas are even like blazing fires. They incur no fault in consequence of teaching, of officiating at sacrifices, and of accepting gifts from others. Whether the Brahmana be cognisant of the Vedas or ignorant of them, whether they be pure or impure, they should never be insulted, for Brahmanas are like fires. As the fire that blazeth up in the place set apart for the cremation of the dead is never regarded impure on that account, so the Brahmana, be he learned or ignorant, is always pure. He is great and a very god! Cities that are adorned with walls and gates and palaces one after another, lose their beauty if they are bereft of Brahmanas. That, indeed, O king, is a city where Brahmanas accomplished in the Vedas, duly observing the duties of their order and possessed of learning and ascetic merit, reside. O son of Pritha, that spot, be it a wood or pasture land, where learned Brahmanas reside, hath been called a city. And that place, O king, becometh a tirtha also. By approaching a king that offereth protection, as also a Brahmana possessed of ascetic merit, and by offering worship unto both, a man may purge off his sins immediately. The learned have said that ablutions in the sacred tirthas, recitation of the names of holy ones, and converse with the good and virtuous, are all acts worthy of applause. They that are virtuous and honest always regard themselves as sanctified by the holy companionship of persons like themselves and by the water of pure and sacred converse. The carrying of three staffs, the vow of silence, matted hair on head, the shaving of the crown, covering one's person with barks and deerskins, the practice of vows, ablutions, the worship of fire, abode in the woods, emaciating the body, all these are useless if the heart be not pure. The indulgence of the six senses is easy, if purity be not sought in the object of enjoyment. Abstinence, however, which of itself is difficult, is scarcely easy without purity of the objects of enjoyment. O king of kings, among the six senses, the mind alone that is easily moved is the most dangerous! Those high-souled persons that do not commit sins in word, deed, heart and soul, are said to undergo ascetic austerities, and not they that suffer their bodies to be wasted by fasts and penances. He that hath no feeling of kindness for relatives cannot be free from sin even if his body be pure. That hard-heartedness of his is the enemy of his asceticism. Asceticism, again, is not mere abstinence from the pleasures of the world. He that is always pure and decked with virtue, he that practises kindness all his life, is a Muni even though he may lead a domestic life. Such a man is purged of all his sins. Fasts and other penances cannot destroy sins, however much they may weaken and dry up the body that is made of flesh and blood. The man whose heart is without holiness, suffers torture only by undergoing penances in ignorance of their meaning. He is never freed from sins of such acts. The fire he worshippeth doth not consume his sins. It is in consequence of holiness and virtue alone that men attain to regions of blessedness, and fasts and vows become efficacious. Subsistence on fruits and roots, the vow of silence, living upon air, the shaving of the crown, abandonment of a fixed home, the wearing of matted locks on the head, lying under the canopy of heaven, daily fasts, the worship of fire, immersion in water, and lying on the bare ground, --these alone cannot produce such a result. They only that are possessed of holiness succeed, by knowledge and deeds, to conquer disease, decrepitude and death, and acquire a high status. As seeds that have been scorched by fire do not sprout forth, so the pains that have been burnt by knowledge cannot effect the soul. This inert body that is only like a block of wood when destitute of souls, is, without doubt, short lived like froth in the ocean. He that obtaineth a view of his soul, the soul that resideth in every body, by help of one or half of a rhythmic line (of the Vedas), hath no more need for anything. Some obtaining a knowledge of identity with the Supreme Soul from but two letters (of the Vedas) and some from hundreds and thousands of rhythmic lines, acquire salvation, for the knowledge of one's identity with the Supreme Soul is the sure indication of salvation. The men of old, distinguished for their knowledge, have said, neither this world nor that hereafter nor bliss can be his who is disturbed by doubts. And belief of one's identity with the Supreme Soul is the indication of salvation. He that knoweth the true meaning of the Vedas, understandeth their true use. Such a man is affrighted at the Vedic ritual like a man at sight of a forest conflagration. Giving up dry disputation, have recourse to Sruti and Smriti, and seek thou, with the aid of thy reason, the knowledge of the Undecaying One that is without a second. One's search (after this knowledge) becometh futile from defect of means. Therefore, should one carefully strive to obtain that knowledge by aid of the Vedas. The Vedas are the Supreme Soul; they are His body; they are the Truth. The soul that is bounded by the animal organism is incompetent to know Him in whom all the Vedas merge. That Supreme Soul, however, is capable of being known by the pure intellect. The existence of the gods as stated in the Vedas, the efficacy of acts, and the capacity for action of being furnished with bodies, are noticeable in every Yuga. Independence of these and annihilation are to be sought from purity of the senses. Therefore, the suspension of the function of the senses is the true fasting. One may attain to heaven by asceticism, one may obtain objects of enjoyment by the practice of charity and may have his sins purged off by ablutions in tirthas. But complete emancipation cannot be had except by knowledge.'\",\n",

He that can always realise the identity of all things with his own self certainly attains to immortality. The very gods are stupefied in the track of that trackless man who constitutes himself the soul of all creatures, who is engaged in the good of all beings, and who desire to attain to (Brahma which is) the final refuge (of all things). Indeed, the track which is pursued by men of knowledge is as visible as that of birds in the sky or of fish in water. Time of its own power, cooks all entities within itself. No one, however, knows That in which Time, in its turn, is itself cooked. That (of which I speak) does not occur above, or in the middle or below, or in transverse or in any other direction. That is to tangible entity; it is not to be found in any place. All these worlds are within That. There is nothing in these worlds that exists out of that. Even if one goes on ceaselessly with the celerity of a shaft impelled from the bow-string, even if one goes on with the speed of the mind, itself, one would not still reach the end of that which is the cause of all this. That is so gross that there is nothing grosser. His hands and feet extend everywhere. His eyes, head, and face are everywhere. His ears are everywhere in the universe. He exists overwhelming all things. That is minuter than the minutest, that is the heart of all entities. Existing, without doubt, that is still imperceptible. Indestructible and destructible, --these are the dual forms of existence of the (Supreme) Soul. In all mobile and immobile entities the existence it displays is destructible; while the existence it displays in Chaitanya is celestial, immortal, and indestructible. Though the lord of all existent beings both mobile and immobile, though inactive and divested of attributes, it enters, nevertheless, the well-known mansion of nine doors and becomes engaged in action. Men of wisdom who are capable of beholding the other shore say that the Unborn (or the Supreme Soul) becomes invested with the attribute of action in consequence of motion, pleasure and pain, variety of form, and the nine well-known possessions. That indestructible Soul which is said to be invested with the attribute of action is nothing else than that indestructible Soul which is said to be inactive. A person of knowledge, by attaining to that indestructible essence, gives up for good both life and birth.' SECTION CCXL 'Vyasa said, 'O excellent son, asked by thee, I have told thee truly what the answer to thy question should be according to the doctrine of knowledge as expounded in the Sankhya system. Listen now to me as I expound to thee all that should be done (for the same end) according to the Yoga doctrine. The uniting together of Intellect and Mind, and all the Senses, and the all-pervading Soul is said to be Knowledge of the foremost kind. That Knowledge should be acquired (through the preceptor's aid) by one that is of a tranquil disposition, that has mastered his senses, that is capable (by meditation) of turning his gaze on the Soul, that takes a pleasure in (such) meditation, that is endued with intelligence and pure in acts. One should seek to acquire this Knowledge by abandoning those five impediments of Yoga which are known to the wise, viz., desire, wrath, cupidity, fear, and sleep. Wrath is conquered by tranquillity of disposition. Desire is conquered by giving up all purposes. By reflecting with the aid of the understanding upon topics worthy of reflection, one endued with patience succeeds in abandoning sleep. By steady endurance one should restrain one's organs of generation and the stomach (from unworthy or sinful indulgence). One should protect one's hands and feet by (using) one's eyes. One should protect one's eyes and ears by the aid of one's mind, one's mind and speech by one's acts. One should avoid fear by heedfulness, and pride by waiting upon the wise. Subduing procrastination, one should, by these means, subdue these impediments of Yoga. One should pay one's adorations to fire and the Brahmanas, and one should bow one's head to the deities. One should avoid all kinds of inauspicious discourse, and speech that is fraught with malice, and words that are painful to other minds. Brahma is the effulgent seed (of everything). It is, again, the essence of that seed whence is all this. Brahma became the eye, in the form of this mobile and immobile universe, of all entities that took birth. Meditation, study, gift, truth, modesty, simplicity, forgiveness, purity of body, purity of conduct, subjugation of the senses, these enhance one's energy, which (when enhanced) destroys one's sins. By behaving equally towards all creatures and by living in contentment upon what is acquired easily and without effort, one attains to the fruition of all one's objects and succeeds in obtaining knowledge. Cleansed of all sins, endued with energy, abstemious in diet, with senses under complete control, one should, after having subdued both desire and wrath, seek to attain to Brahma, Firmly uniting the senses and the mind (having drawn them away from all external objects) with gaze fixed inwards, one should, in the still hours of evening or in those before dawn, place one's mind upon the knowledge. If even one of the five senses of a human being be kept unrestrained, all his wisdom may be seen to escape through it like water through an unstopped hole at the bottom of a leathern bag. The mind in the first instance should be sought to be restrained by the Yogin after the manner of a fisherman seeking at the outset to render that one among the fish powerless from which there is the greatest danger to his nets. Having first subdued the mind, the Yogin should then proceed to subdue his ears, then his eyes, then his tongue, and then his nose. Having restrained these, he should fix them on the mind. Then withdrawing the mind from all purposes, he should fix it on the knowledge. Indeed, having restrained the five senses, the Yati should fix them on the mind. When these the mind for their sixth become concentrated in the knowledge, and thus concentrated remain steady and untroubled, then Brahma becomes perceptible like a smokeless fire of blazing flames or the Sun of effulgent radiance. Indeed, one then beholds in oneself one's soul like lightning fire in the skies. Everything then appears in it and it appears in everything in consequence of its infinitude. Those high-souled Brahmanas that are possessed of wisdom, that are endued with fortitude, that are possessed of high knowledge, and that are engaged in the good of all creatures, succeed in beholding it. Engaged in the observance of austere vows, the Yogin who conducts himself thus for six months, seated by himself on an isolated spot, succeeds in attaining to an equality with the Indestructible. Annihilation, extension, power to present varied aspects in the same person or body, celestial scents, and sounds, and sights, the most agreeable sensations of taste and touch, pleasurable sensations of coolness and warmth, equality with the wind, capability of understanding (by inward light) the meaning of scriptures and every work of genius, companionship of celestial damsels, --acquiring all these by Yoga the Yogin should disregard them and merge them all in the knowledge. Restraining speech and the senses one should practise Yoga during the hours after dusk, the hours\",\n",

Those best of  kings, came to the Horse -sacrifice of the Kuru monarch for doing what was  agreeable to him. And they brought many gems with them and many  female  slaves and horses and weapons. The sounds that  arose from those  high-souled kings who resided within those pavilions touched the very  heavens and resembled the noise made by the roaring ocean. King  Yudhishthira, the delighter of the Kurus, assigned unto the monarchs who  thus came to his sacrifice dive rse kinds of food and drink, and beds also  of celestial beauty. The chief of the Bharatas, viz., king Yudhishthira  the just, assigned several stables well filled with different kinds of  corn and sugarcane and milk to the animals (that came with the guests) . To that great sacrifice of king Yudhishthira the just who was possessed  of high intelligence, there also came a large number of Munis all of whom  were utterers of Brahman. Indeed, O lord of Earth, all the foremost ones  among the regenerate class that wer e then alive, came to that sacrifice,  accompanied by their  disciples. The Kuru king received them all. King  Yudhishthira of mighty energy, casting off all pride, himself followed  all his  guests to the pavilions that had been assigned for their  residence. T hen all the mechanics and engineers, having completed the  arrangements of the  sacrifice informed king Yudhishthira of it. Hearing  that everything was ready, king Yudhishthira the just, full of alertness  and attention, became highly glad along with his brot hers all of whom  honoured him duly.'\",\n",

I think, therefore, ye should not go thither yourselves! Defeated by deceitful means they are now living in the deep forest in great suffering. O Radheya, they are mighty warriors and naturally able, they are now devoted to ascetic austerities. King Yudhishthira will not suffer his wrath to be awakened, but Bhimasena is naturally passionate.

A mighty warrior as he is and accomplished in arms now, will he not be able to slay you all? Or, if in obedience to my words, ye behave carefully having repaired thither, ye will not be able to live happily there in consequence of the anxiety ye will feel owing to a state of continued trustlessness. Or, some soldier of yours may do some injury to Yudhishthira, and that unpremeditated act will be ascribed to your fault. Therefore, let some faithful men proceed there for the work of tale.

He pledged in the midst of the assembly, O Bharata, that he would live for twelve years in the forest. The other sons of Pandu are all virtuous and obedient to Yudhishthira. And Yudhishthira himself, the son of Kunti, will never be angry with us. Indeed, we desire very much to go on a hunting expedition, and will avail of that opportunity for supervising the tale of our cattle. We have no mind to see the sons of Pandu. We will not go to that spot where the Pandavas have taken up their residence, and consequently no exhibition of misconduct can possibly arise on our part.\\' Vaisampayana continued, \\'Thus addressed by Sakuni, that lord of men, Dhritarashtra, granted permission, but not very willingly, to Duryodhana and his counsellors to go to the place.

And those mighty chariot-fighters proceeded by slow stages staying for some time within those beautiful woods and by fine lakes that they beheld along their way. Devoted to study, pure in their practices, amiable, and sweet-speeched, the Pandavas at last entered the country of the Panc halas. And beholding the capital, as also the fort, they took up their quarters in the house of a potter, Adopting the Brahmanical profession, they began to lead an eleemosynary life. And no men recognised those heroes during their stay in Drupada\\'s capital.\\n\\n\"Yajnasena always cherished the desire of bestowing his daughter on Kiriti (Arjuna), the son of Pandu. But he never spoke of it to anybody. And, O Janamejaya, the king of Panchala thinking of Arjuna caused a very stiff bow to be made that was incapable of being bent by any except Arjuna. Causing some machinery to be erected in the sky, the king set up a mark attached to that machinery. And Drupada said, \\'He that will string this bow and with these well-adorned arrows shoot the mark above the machine shall obtain my daughter.\\'\\n\\n\"Vaisampayana continued, \\'With these words king Drupada proclaimed the Swayamvara. On hearing of them, O Bharata, the kings of other lands came to his capital. And there came also many illustrious Rishis desirous of beholding the Swayamvara. And there came also, O king, Duryodhana and the Kurus accompanied by Kama. There also came many superior Brahmanas from every country. And the monarchs who came there were all received with reverence by the illustrious Drupada. Desirous of beholding the Swayamvara, the citizens, roaring like the sea, all took their seats on the platforms that were erected around the amphitheatre. The monarch entered the grand amphitheatre by the north-eastern gate. And the amphitheatre which itself had been erected on an auspicious and level plain to the north-east of Drupada\\'s capital, was surrounded by beautiful mansions. And it was enclosed on all sides with high walls and a moat with arched doorways here and there. The vast amphitheatre was also shaded by a canopy of various colours. And resounding with the notes of thousands of trumpets, it was scented with black aloes and sprinkled all over with water mixed with sandal-paste and decorated with garlands of flowers. It was surrounded with high mansions perfectly white and resembling the cloud-kissing peaks of Kailasa. The windows of those mansions were covered with net works of gold; the walls were set with diamonds and precious costly carpets and cloths. All those mansions adorned with wreaths and garlands of flowers and rendered fragrant with excellent aloes, were all white and spotless, like unto the necks of swans. And the fragrance therefrom could be perceived from the distance of a Yojana (eight miles). And they were each furnished with a hundred doors wide enough to admit a crowd of persons; they were adorned with costly beds and carpets, and beautified with various metals; they resembled the peaks of the Himavat. And in those seven-storied houses of various sizes dwelt the monarchs invited by Drupada whose persons were adorned with every ornament and who were possessed with the desire of excelling one another. And the inhabitants of the city and the country who had come to behold Krishna and taken their seats on the excellent platforms erected around, beheld seated within those mansions those lions among kings who were all endued with the energy of great souls. And those exalted sovereigns were all adorned with the fragrant paste of the black aloe. Of great liberality, they were all devoted to Brahma and they protected their kingdoms against all foes. And for their own good deeds they were loved by the whole world.\\n\\n\"The Pandavas, too, entering that amphitheatre, sat with the Brahmanas and beheld the unequalled affluence of the king of the Panchalas. And that concourse of princes, Brahmanas, and others, looking gay at the performances of actors and dancers (large presents of every kind of wealth being constantly made), began to swell day by day. And it lasted, O king, several days, till on the sixteenth day when it was at its full, the daughter of Drupada, O thou bull of the Bharata race, having washed herself clean entered the amphitheatre, richly attired and adorned with every ornament and bearing in her hand a dish of gold (whereon were the usual offerings of Arghya) and a garland of flowers. Then the priest of the lunar race --a holy Brahmana conversant with all mantras --ignited the sacrificial fire and poured on it with due rites libations of clarified butter. And gratifying Agni by these libations and making the Brahmanas utter the auspicious formula of benediction, stopped the musical instruments that were playing all around. And when that vast amphitheatre, O monarch, became perfectly still, Dhrishtadyumna possessed of a voice deep as the sound of the kettledrum or the clouds, taking hold of his sister\\'s arm, stood in the midst of that concourse, and said, with a voice loud and deep as the roar of the clouds, these charming words of excellent import, \\'Hear ye assembled kings, this is the bow, that is the mark, and these are the arrows. Shoot the mark through the orifice of the machine with these five sharpened arrows. Truly do I say that, possessed of lineage, beauty of persons, and strength whoever achieveth this great feat shall obtain today this my sister, Krishna for his wife.\\' Having thus spoken unto the assembled monarchs Drupada\\'s son then addressed his sister, reciting unto her the names and lineages and achievements of those assembled lords of the earth.\\'\"',\n",

O Saint, who deemest thy religious practices as thy only treasure. O thou of the priestly class! I wish to hear the account of the achievements of the king, narrated in detail by thyself.' 'Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed by the magnanimous and virtuous king, he, the chief of men of the priestly class, narrated the achievements of the high-souled (king) Sagara.' 'Lomasa said, 'There was born in the family of the Ikshaku tribe, a ruler of the earth named Sagara, endued with beauty, and strength. And that same (king) of a dreaded name was sonless, O descendant of Bharata! And he carried havoc through the tribes of the Haihayas and the Talajanghas; brought under subjection the whole of the military caste; (and so) ruled over his own kingdom. And, O most praiseworthy of the descendants of Bharata! O chief of the Bharata race! he had two wives proud of their beauty and of their youth, --one a princess of the Vidarbha race, and the other of the royal line of Sivi. And, O chief of kings, that same ruler of men, betook himself to the mountain Kailasa, accompanied by both his wives, and with the desire of having a son became engaged in the practice of exceeding austere penances. And being engaged in the practice of rigid austerities, and (also) employed in the contemplation known by the name of Yoga, he obtained the sight of the magnanimous god with three eyes--the slayer of the demon called Tripura; the worker of blessings (for all beings); the (eternally) existent one; the ruling Being, the holder of the Pinaka bow; carrying in his hand his (well-known weapon) --the trident; the god of three eyes; the repository of (eternal) peace; the ruler of all those that are fierce; capable of assuming very many forms; and the lord of the goddess Uma. And that same ruler of men, of mighty arms, as soon as he beheld the god --that giver of boons --fell down at his feet, with both his queens, and proffered a prayer to have a son. And the god Siva, well pleased with him, spake (thus) to that most righteous of the rulers of men, attended by his two wives, saying, 'O lord of men! considering the (astrological) moment at which thou hast proffered thy prayer to me, sixty thousand sons, O foremost of choice men valorous and characterised by exceeding pride, will be born in one off thy two wives (here ). But they all, O ruler of the earth, shall perish together. In the other wife, (however), will be born a single valiant son, who will perpetuate thy race.' Having said this to him, the god Rudra (Siva) vanished from sight at that very spot, and that same king Sagara now came (back) to his own abode accompanied by his two wives, exceedingly delighted at heart (for what had happened) then. And, O most praiseworthy of the sons of Manu! (i.e., men), there the two lotus-eyed wives of him --the princess of Vidarbha and the princess of Sivi --came (erelong) to be with child. And afterwards, on the due day, the princess of Vidarbha brought forth (something) of the shape of a gourd and the princess of Sivi gave birth to a boy as beautiful as a god. Then the ruler of the earth made up his mind to throw away the gourd, --when he heard (proceeding) from the sky a speech (uttered) in a grave and solemn voice, 'O king! do thou not be guilty of this hasty act; thou shouldst not abandon thy sons. Take out the seeds from the gourd and let them be preserved with care in steaming vessels partly filled with clarified butter. Then thou wilt get, O scion of Bharata's race! sixty thousand sons. O ruler of men! the great god (Siva) hath spoken that thy sons are to be born in this manner. Let not therefore thy mind be turned away therefrom.' SECTION CVII 'Lomasa said, 'O most righteous of kings! When he heard these words (proceeding) from the sky, he had faith therein, and did all that he was directed to do, O chief of the men of Bharata's race! Then the ruler of men took separately each of the seeds and then placed these divisions (of the gourd) in vessels filled with clarified butter. And intent on the preservation of his sons, he provided a nurse for every (receptacle). Then after a long time there arose sixty thousand exceedingly powerful sons of that same king --gifted with unmeasured strength, they were born, O ruler of earth! to that saint-like king, by Rudra's favour. And they were terrible; and their acts were ruthless. And they were able to ascend and roam about in the sky; and being numerous themselves, despised everybody, including the gods. And they would chase even the gods, the Gandharvas, and the Rakshasas and all the born beings, being themselves valiant and addicted to fighting. Then all people, harassed by the dull-headed sons of Sagara, united with all the gods, went to Brahma as their refuge. And then addressed the blessed grandfather of all beings (Brahma), 'Go ye your way, ye gods, together with all these men. In a not very long space of time, there will come about, O gods! a great and exceedingly terrible destruction of Sagara's sons, caused by the deed perpetrated by them.' Thus addressed, those same gods, and men, O lord of the sons of Manu! bade adieu to the grandfather, and went back to whence they had come. Then, O chief of Bharata's race! after the expiry of very many days, the mighty king Sagara accepted the consecration for performing the rites of a horse-sacrifice. And his horse began to roam over the world, protected by his sons. And when the horse reached the sea, waterless and frightful to behold --although the horse was guarded with very great care --it (suddenly) vanished at the very spot (it stood upon). Then, O respected sir! those same sons of Sagara imagined the same fine horse to have been stolen; and returning to their father, narrated how it had been stolen out of sight. And thereupon he addressed them, saying, 'Go ye and search for the horse in all the cardinal points.' Then, O great king! by this command of their father, they began to search for the horse in the cardinal points and throughout the whole surface of the earth. But all those sons of Sagara, all mutually united, could not find the horse, nor the person who had stolen it. And coming back then, they with joined palms (thus addressed) their father, (standing) before them, 'O Protector of men! O ruler of the earth! O king! by thy command, the whole of this world with its hills and its forest tracts, with its seas, and its woods, and its islands, with its rivulets and rivers and caves, hath been searched through by us.

       " {'text': \"might, delighting in battle and armed with maces, these all --united with the Kurus and fighting wrathfully for Duryodhana's sake were incapable of being vanquished in battle by anybody else save thee, O scorcher of foes! What man, unprotected by thee, could advance, beholding the mighty and swelling host of the Dhartarashtras arrayed in order of battle? Protected by thee, O puissant one, the Pandavas, filled with wrath, and penetrating into its midst, have destroyed that host shrouded with dust and resembling a swollen sea. Seven days have elapsed since the mighty Jayatsena, the ruler of the Magadhas, was slain in battle by Abhimanyu. After that, 10,000 elephants, of fierce feats, that used to follow that king, were slain by Bhimasena with his mace. After that, other elephants, and car-warriors, by hundreds, have been destroyed by Bhima in that exercise of his might. Even thus, O Partha, during the progress of this awful battle, the Kauravas, with their steeds and carwarriors and elephants, encountering Bhimasena and thee, O son of Pandu, have from hence repaired to the region of Death. The van of the Kaurava army, O Partha, having been struck down by the Pandavas, Bhishma shot showers of fierce shafts, O sire! Conversant with the highest weapons, he shrouded the Cedis, the Pancalas, the Karushas, the Matsyas, and the Kaikayas with the shafts, and deprived them of life! The welkin became filled with gold-winged and straight coursing shafts, capable of piercing the bodies of all foes, that issued out of his bow. He slew thousands of car-warriors, shooting showers of shafts at a time. In all, he slew a 100,000 men and elephants of great might. Abandoning the diverse motions, each of a new kind, in which they careered, those wicked kings and elephants, while perishing, destroyed many steeds and cars and elephants. Indeed, numberless were the shafts that Bhishma shot in battle. Slaughtering the Pandava host for ten days together, Bhishma made the terraces of numberless cars empty and deprived innumerable elephants and steeds of life. Having assumed the form of Rudra or of Upendra in battle, he afflicted the Pandava divisions and caused a great carnage amongst them. Desirous of rescuing the wicked Suyodhana who was sinking in a raftless sea, he slaughtered many lords of Earth among the Cedis, the Pancalas, and the Kaikayas, and caused a great massacre of the Pandava army teeming with cars and steeds and elephants. Innumerable foot-soldiers among the Srinjayas, all well-armed, and other lords of earth, were incapable of even looking at that hero when he careered in battle like the Sun himself of scorching splendour. At last the Pandavas, with all their resources, made a mighty effort, and rushed against that warrior who, inspired with the desire of victory, used to career in battle even in this way. Without availing himself of any aid, he routed, however, the Pandavas and the Srinjayas in battle, and came to be regarded as the one foremost hero in the world. Encountering him, Shikhandi, protected by thee, slew that tiger among men with his straight shafts. Having obtained thee that art a tiger among men (as his foe), that grandsire is now stretched on a bed of arrows, like Vritra when he obtained Vasava for his foe. The fierce Drona also slaughtered the hostile army for five days together. Having made an impenetrable array and caused many mighty car-warriors to be slain, that great car-warrior had protected Jayadratha (for some time). Fierce as the Destroyer himself, he caused a great carnage in the nocturnal battle. Endued with great valour, the heroic son of Bharadwaja consumed innumerable combatants with his arrows. At last, encountering Dhrishtadyumna, he attained to the highest end. If, on that day, thou hadst not checked in battle all the (Dhartarashtra) car-warriors headed by the Suta's son, Drona then would never have been slain. Thou heldst in check the whole Dhartarashtra force. It was for this, O Dhananjaya, that Drona could be slain by the son of Prishata. What other Kshatriya, save thee, could in battle achieve such feats for compassing the slaughter of Jayadratha. Checking the vast (Kaurava) army and slaying many brave kings, thou killedest king Jayadratha, aided by the might and energy of thy weapons. All the kings regarded the slaughter of the ruler of the Sindhus to have been exceedingly wonderful. I, however, do not regard it so; thou didst it and thou art a great car-warrior. If this vast assemblage of Kshatriyas, obtaining thee as a foe, suffer extermination in course of even a whole day, I should, I think, still regard these Kshatriyas to be truly mighty. When Bhishma and Drona have been slain, the terrible Dhartarashtra host, O Partha, may be regarded to have lost all its heroes. Indeed, with all its foremost warriors slain, with its steeds, cars, and elephants destroyed, the Bharata army looketh today like the firmament, reft of the Sun, the Moon, and stars. Yonder host of fierce prowess, O Partha, hath been shorn of its splendours today like the Asura host in days of yore shorn of its splendours by Sakra's prowess. The remnant of that grand master now consists of only five great car-warriors, viz., Ashvatthama, Kritavarma, Karna, Shalya, and Kripa. Slaying those five great car-warriors today, O tiger among men, be thou a hero that hath killed all his foes, and bestow thou the Earth with all her islands and cities on king Yudhishthira. Let Pritha's son Yudhishthira of immeasurable energy and prosperity, obtain today the whole earth with the welkin above it, the waters on it, and the nether regions below it. Slaying this host like Vishnu in days of yore slaying the Daityas and the Danavas, bestow the Earth on the king like Hari bestowing (the three worlds) on Sakra. Let the Pancalas rejoice today, their foes being slain, like the celestials rejoicing after the slaughter of the Danavas by Vishnu. If in consequence of thy regard for that foremost of men, viz., thy preceptor Drona, thou cherishest compassion for Ashvatthama, if, again, thou hast any kindness for Kripa for the sake of respect that is due to a preceptor, if, approaching Kritavarma, thou dost not despatch him today to Yama's abode in consequence of the honour that is due to one's kinsmen by the mother's side, if, O lotus-eyed one, approaching thy mother's brother, viz., Shalya, the ruler of the Madras, thou dost not from compassion slay him, I ask thee, do thou, with keen shafts, O foremost of men slay Karna today with speed, that vile wretch of sinful heart who cherisheth the fiercest hate for the son of Pandu. This is thy noblest duty. There is nothing in it that would be improper. We approve of it, and here is no fault in the act. The wicked-souled Karna is the root, O thou of unfading glory, of that attempt, O sinless one, made in the night for burning thy mother with all her children, and of that conduct which Suyodhana adopted towards you in consequence of that match at dice. Suyodhana always hopeth for deliverance through Karna. Filled with rage, he endeavours to afflict me also (in consequence of that support). It is the firm belief of Dhritarashtra's royal son, O giver of honours, that Karna, without doubt, will slay all the Prithas in battle. Though fully acquainted with thy might, still, O son of Kunti, Dhritarashtra's son hath selected war with you in consequence of his reliance on Karna. Karna also always says, 'I will vanquish the assembled Parthas and that mighty car-warrior, viz., Vasudeva of Dasharha's race'. Buoying up the wicked-souled son of Dhritarashtra, the wicked Karna always roareth in the (Kuru) assembly. Slay him today, O Bharata. In all the acts of injury, of which Dhritarashtra's son hath been guilty towards you, the wicked-souled Karna of sinful understanding hath been the leader. I saw the heroic son of Subhadra of\",\n",

Similarly, the mighty Bhurishrava, with one of his arms lopped off and while observant of the Praya vow, was caused to be slain by thee through the agency of the high-souled Satyaki.

Human enjoyments such as were worthy of the very gods and such as could with difficulty be obtained by other kings, had been mine. Prosperity of the very highest kind had been attained by me!

Fragrant and delicious breezes mildly blew on every side. All the quarters became clear and the firmament looked blue as the lapis lazuli. Beholding these exceedingly wonderful things and this worship offered to Duryodhana, the Pandavas headed by Vasudeva became ashamed.

Beholding the Pandavas filled with anxiety and grief, Krishna addressed them in a voice deep as that of the clouds or the drum, saying, 'All of them were great car-warriors and exceedingly quick in the use of weapons! If ye had put forth all your prowess, even then ye could never have slain them in battle by fighting fairly! King Duryodhana also could never be slain in a fair encounter! The same is the case with all those mighty car-warriors headed by Bhishma! From desire of doing good to you, I repeatedly applied my powers of illusion and caused them to be slain by diverse means in battle. If I had not adopted such deceitful ways in battle, victory would never have been yours, nor kingdom, nor wealth! Those four were very high-souled warriors and regarded as Atirathas in the world. The very Regents of the Earth could not slay them in fair fight! Similarly, the son of Dhritarashtra, though fatigued when armed with the mace, could not be slain in fair fight by Yama himself armed with his bludgeon! You should not take it to heart that this foe of yours hath been slain deceitfully. When the number of one's foes becomes great, then destruction should be effected by contrivances and means. The gods themselves, in slaying the Asuras, have trod the same way. That way, therefore, that hath been trod by the gods, may be trod by all. We have been crowned with success. It is evening. We had better depart to our tents. Let us all, ye kings, take rest with our steeds and elephants and cars.' Hearing these words of Vasudeva, the Pandavas and the Pancalas, filled with delight, roared like a multitude of lions. All of them blew their conchs and Jadava himself blew Panchajanya, filled with joy, O bull among men, at the sight of Duryodhana struck down in battle.'\",\n",

Felling the steeds yoked to Kripa's car, as also both his Parshni charioteers, Abhimanyu pierced Kripa himself in the centre of the chest with ten arrows. The mighty Abhimanyu, then, in the very sight of thy heroic sons, slew the brave Vrindaraka, that enhancer of the fame of the Kurus. While Abhimanyu was thus engaged in fearlessly slaying one after another the foremost warriors among his enemies, Drona's son Aswatthaman pierced him with five and twenty small arrows. The son of Arjuna, however, in the very sight of all the Dhartarashtras quickly pi erced Aswatthaman in return, O sire, with many whetted shafts. Drona's son, however, in return, piercing Abhimanyu with sixty fierce arrows of great impetuosity and keen sharpness, failed to make him tremble, for the latter, pierced by Aswatthaman, stood immovable like the Mainaka mountain. Endued with great energy, the mighty Abhimanyu then pierced his antagonist with three and seventy straight arrows, equipped with wings of gold. Drona then, desirous of rescuing his son, pierced Abhimanyu with a hundred arrows. And Aswatthaman pierced him with sixty arrows, desirous of rescuing his father. And Karna struck him with two and twenty broad-headed arrows and Kritavarman struck him with four and ten. And Vrihadvala pierced him with fifty such shafts, and Saradwata's son, Kripa, with ten. Abhimanyu, however, pierced each of these in return with ten shafts. The ruler of the Kosala struck Abhimanyu, in the chest with a barbed arrow. Abhimanyu, however, quickly felled on the earth his antagonist's steeds and standard and bow and charioteer. The ruler of the Kosalas, then, thus deprived of his car, took up a sword and wished to sever from Abhimanyu's trunk his beautiful head, decked with ear-rings. Abhimanyu then pierced king Vrihadvala, the ruler of the Kosalas, in the chest, with a strong arrow. The latter then, with riven heart, fell down. Beholding this, ten thousand illustrious kings broke and fled. Those kings, armed with swords and bows, fled away, uttering words inimical (to king Duryodhana's Interest). Having slain[77] Vrihadvala thus, the son of Subhadra careered it battle, paralysing thy warriors, ---those great bowmen, --by means of arrowy downpours, thick as rain.' SECTION XLVI 'Sanjaya said, 'Phalguni's son once more pierced Karna in the car with a barbed arrow, and for angering him still further, he pierced him with fifty other shafts. The son of Radha pierced Abhimanyu in return with as many shafts. Covered all over with arrows, Abhimanyu, then, O sire, looked exceedingly beautiful. Filled with rage, he caused Karna also to be bathed in blood. Mangled with arrows and covered with blood, the brave Karna also shone greatly. Both of them pierced with arrows, both bathed in blood, those illustrious warriors then resembled a couple of flowering Kinsukas. The son of Subhadra then slew six of Karna's brave counsellors, conversant with all modes of warfare, with their steeds and charioteers and cars. As regards other great bowmen Abhimanyu fearlessly pierced each of them in return, with ten arrows. That feat of his seemed highly wonderful. Slaying next the son of the ruler of the Magadhas, Abhimanyu, with six straight shafts, slew the youthful Aswaketu with his four steeds and charioteer. Then slaying, with a sharp razor-headed arrow, the Bhoja prince of Martikavata, bearing the device of an elephant (on his banner), the son of Arjuna uttered a loud shout and began to scatter his shafts on all sides. Then the son of Duhsasana pierced the four steeds of Abhimanyu with four shafts, his charioteer with one and Abhimanyu himself with ten. The son of Arjuna, then, piercing Duhsasana's son with ten fleet shafts, addressed him in a loud tone and with eyes red in wrath, said, 'Abandoning the battle, thy sire hath fled like a coward. It is well thou knowest how to fight. Thou shalt not, however, escape today with life.' Saying these words unto him, Abhimanyu sped a long arrow, well polished by smith's hand, at his foe. The son of Drona cut that arrow with three shafts of his own. Leaving Aswatthaman alone, Arjuna's son struck Salya, in return, fearlessly pierced him in the chest with highly nine shafts, equipped with vulture's feathers. That feat seemed highly wonderful. The son of Arjuna then cut off Salya's bow and slew both his Parshni charioteers. Abhimanyu then p ierced Salya himself with six shafts made wholly of iron. Thereupon, the latter, leaving that steedless car, mounted another. Abhimanyu then slew five warriors., named Satrunjaya, and Chandraketu, and Mahamegba, and Suvarchas, and Suryabhasa. He then pierced Suvala's son. The latter piercing Abhimanyu with three arrows, said unto Duryodhana, 'Let us all together grind this one, else, fighting singly with us he will slay us all. O king, think of the means of slaying this one, taking counsel with Drona and Kripa and others.' The Karna, the son of Vikartana, said unto Drona, 'Abhimanyu grindeth us all. Tell us the means by which we may slay him.' Thus addressed, the mighty bowman, Drona, addressing them all, said, 'Observing him with vigilance, have any of you been able to detect any defeat in this youth? He is careening in all directions. Yet have any of you been able to detect today the least hole in him? Behold the lightness of hand and quickness of motion of this lion among men, this son of Arjuna. In the track of his car, only his bow drawn to a circle can be seen, so quickly is he aiming his shafts and so quickly is he letting them off. Indeed, this slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of Subhadra, gratifieth me although he afflicteth my vital breath and stupefieth me with shafts. Even the mightiest car-warriors, filled with wrath, are unable to detect any flaw in him. The son of Subhadra, therefore, careering on the field of battle, gratifieth me greatly. I do not see that in battle there is any differen ce between the wielder of Gandiva himself and this one of great lightness of hand, filling all the points of the horizon with his mighty shafts.' Hearing these words, Karna, afflicted with the shafts of Arjuna's son, once more said unto Drona, 'Exceedingly afflicted with the shafts of Abhimanyu, I am staying in battle, only because (as a warrior) I should stay here. Indeed, the arrows of this south of great energy are exceedingly fierce. Terrible as they are and possessed of the energy of fire, these arrows are weakening my heart.' The preceptor then, slowly and with a smile, said unto Karna, 'Abhimanyu is young, his prowess is great. His coat of mail is impenetrable. This one's father had been taught by me the method of wearing defensive armour. This subjugator of hostile towns assuredly knoweth the entire science (of wearing armour). With shafts well shot, you can, however, cut off his bow, bow-string, the reins of his steeds, the steeds themselves, and two Parshni charioteers. O mighty bowman, O son of Radha, if competent, do this. Making him turn back from the fight (by this means), strike him then. With his bow in hand he is incapable of being vanquished by the very gods and the Asuras together. If you wish, deprive him of his car, and divest him of his bow.'. Hearing these words of the preceptor, Vikartana's son Karna quickly cut off, by means of his shafts, the bow of Abhimanyu, as the latter was shooting with great activity.

The  son that is begotten upon one\\'s wife by a person  whom one has invited for  the task, is called Niruktaja. The son that is begotten upon one\\'s wife  by somebody without one\\'s  permission, is Prasritaja. The son begotten  upon his o wn wife by a person fallen away from his status is called  Patitaja. There  are two other sons, viz., the son given, and the son  made. There is another called Adhyudha.[302] The son born of a  maiden in  her father\\'s house is called Kanina. Besides these, ther e are six kinds  of sons called Apadhwansaja and six others that are  Apasadas.

They are, as thus  explained, of six kinds.  Listen now to me as I tell thee who the  Apasadas, are. The son that a Sudra begets  upon a Brahmana woman is  called a  Chandala. Begotten upon a Kshatriya woman by a person of the  Sudra order, the son is called a Vratya. He who is born of a  Vaisya woman  by a Sudra father is called a Vaidya. These three kinds of sons are  called Apasadas. T he Vaisya, by uniting  himself with a woman of the  Brahmana order, begets a son that is called a Magadha, while the son  that  he gets upon a  Kshatriya woman is called a Vamaka.

Whence does the  husband of the  woman that brings forth  the son derive his right to the latter? Similarly, the son called  Adhyudha should be known to be the son  of him from whose seed he has  sprung. How can they be sons of others by reasons of the engagement about  owning and rearing  them having been broken?\\'  \\n\\n\"Bhishma said, \\'He who having begotten a son of his own loins, abandons  him for some reason or other, cannot be regarded as  the sire of such a  son, for vital seed only cannot create sonship.

When a man, desiring to have a  son, weds a girl quick with child, the son born of his spouse must belong  to him, for it is  the fruit of his own soil. The person from whose vital  seed the son has sprung can have no r ight to such a son. The son that is  born in one\\'s soil but not begotten by the owner, O  chief of Bharata\\'s  race, bears all the marks of the sire that has actually  begotten him  (and  not the marks of one that is only the husband of his mother).

I will slay all these today in thy sight, without doubt. Therefore, O charioteer, guide my steed in battle with care.' Having said this, O monarch, Pritha's son pierced thy son with sharp-pointed arrows decked with gold. And he pierced Nandaka in return with three arrows between his two breasts. Then Duryodhana having pierced the mighty Bhima with six arrows pierced Visoka in return with three other sharp arrows. And Duryodhana, O king, as if smiling the while, with three other sharp arrows cut off at the grasp the resplendent bow of Bhima in that battle. Bhima then, that bull among men, beholding his charioteer Visoka afflicted, in that conflict, with sharp shafts by thy son armed with the bow, and unable to bear it, drew another excellent bow, excited with wrath, for the destruction of thy son, O monarch. And excited with great wrath, he also took up an arrow with horse-shoe head and furnished with excellent wings. And with that (arrow) Bhima cut off the excellent bow of the king. Then thy son, excited to the highest pitch of fury, leaving that broken bow aside, speedily took up another that was tougher. And aiming a terrible shaft blazing as Death's rod, the Kuru king, excited with rage struck Bhimasena between his two breasts. Deeply pierced therewith, and greatly pained, he sat down on the terrace of his car. And while seated on the terrace of his car, he swooned away. Beholding Bhima thus unmanned, the illustrious and mighty car-warriors of the Pandava army, headed by Abhimanyu could not bear it. And those warriors then, with great steadiness, showered on thy sons' head a thick down-pour of fierce shafts. Then the mighty Bhimasena, regaining consciousness, pierced Duryodhana at first with those shafts and then with five. And that mighty bowman the son of Pandu then pierced Salya with five and twenty shafts furnished with golden wings. And pierced therewith, Salya was borne away from the battle. Then thy fourteen sons, viz., Senapati, Sushena, Jalasandha, Sulochana, Ugra, Bhimaratha, Bhima, Viravahu, Aolupa, Durmukha, Dushpradarsha, Vivitsu, Vikata, and Sama, then encountered Bhimasena in battle. United together they rushed against Bhimasena, and with eyes red in wrath, showering countless arrows, they pierced him deeply. Then the heroic and mighty Bhimasena of strong arms, beholding thy sons, licking the corners of his mouth like a wolf in the midst of smaller creatures, fell upon them with the impetuosity of Garuda. And the son of Pandu then cut off the head of Senapati with a shaft having a horse-shoe head. And with delighted soul and laughing the while, that mighty-armed warrior, piercing Jalasandha with three arrows, despatched him to Yama's abode. And next, smiting Sushena, he sent him to the presence of Death's self. And with a single broad-headed shaft he felled on the ground the head, handsome as the moon, of Ugra, decked with turban and adorned with ear-rings. And in that battle, Pandu's son Bhima, with seventy shafts, despatched Viravahu to the other world with his steeds and standard and charioteer. And smiling the while, O king, Bhimasena quickly despatched both the brothers Bhima and Bhimaratha also to Yama's abode. And then in that great battle in the very sight of all the troops, with an arrow of horse-shoe head Bhima despatched Sulochana also to Death's domain. Then the rest of thy sons that were there, O king, beholding the prowess of Bhimasena and while thus being struck by that illustrious warrior, all fled from battle from fear of Bhima. Then Santanu's son, addressing all the mighty car-warriors (of his army) said, 'That fierce bowman, Bhima, excited with wrath in battle, is slaying the mighty sons of Dhritarashtra and other heroic car-warriors united together, whatever their knowledge of weapons, and whatever their bravery. Therefore, seize ye all that son of Pandu'. Thus addressed, all the troops of the Dhritarashtra army, excited with rage, rushed towards Bhimasena endued with great might, And Bhagadatta, O king, on his elephant of rent temples, suddenly rushed thither where Bhimasena was stationed. And thither to the combat, he shrouded Bhima with his shafts whetted on stone so as to make him completely invisible, like the clouds covering the sun. Those mighty car-warriors, however, (of the Pandava army), relying on the prowess of their own arms, could not bear that shrouding of Bhima (with the arrowy showers of Bhagadatta). They, therefore, surrounding Bhagadatta on all sides, poured on him their arrowy down-pours. And they pierced his elephant also with showers of shafts. And struck by all those mighty car-warriors with showers of fierce shafts of diverse kinds that elephant, O king, of the ruler of the Pragjyotishas with blood trickling down his body, became beautiful to behold on the field of battle like a mass of clouds tinged with the rays of the sun. And that elephant with temporal juice trickling down urged by Bhagadatta, like the Destroyer, ran with double his former speed, shaking the very earth with his tread. Then all those mighty car-warriors, beholding that terrible mien of the animal, and regarding it irresistible, became cheerless. Then king Bhagadatta, that tiger among men, excited with rage, struck Bhimasena between his two breasts with a straight shaft. Deeply pierced by the king with that shaft, that great bowman and mighty car-warrior, with limbs deprived of sensation in consequence of a swoon, sat down on his car, holding his flagstaff. And beholding those mighty car-warriors terrified and Bhimasena in a swoon, Bhagadatta of great prowess uttered a loud roar. Then, O king, that terrible Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, beholding Bhima in that state, became excited with rage and there and then disappeared from the view. And creating a terrible illusion enhancing the fears of the timid, he reappeared in a moment assuming a fierce form. Himself riding on an Airavata created by his powers of illusion, the other Dik-elephants, viz., Anjana, Vamana, and Mahapadma of blazing glory, followed him. And those three mighty elephants, ridden by Rakshasas, were of huge form, with juice profusely trickling down in three lines, and endued with great speed and prowess. Then Ghatotkacha urged his own elephant to battle, desirous, O chastiser of foes, of slaying Bhagadatta with his elephant. And those other elephants, excited with fury and each endued with four tusks, urged by Rakshasas of great strength, fell from all sides upon Bhagadatta's elephant and afflicted him with their tusks. And the elephant of Bhagadatta, thus afflicted by those elephants, (already) struck with arrows and feeling great pain, uttered loud cries that resembled the thunder of Indra. And hearing those terrible and loud cries of that roaring elephant, Bhishma, addressing Drona, Suyodhana and all the kings, said, 'The mighty bowman Bhagadatta is battling with the wicked-souled son of Hidimva, and hath fallen into great distress. That Rakshasa is of huge form, and the king also is very wrathful. Engaged in battle, they would certainly prove each other's death. Loud shouts were also heard of the rejoicing Pandavas, and the cries of agony of (king Bhagadatta's) terrified elephant. Blessed be ye, let us all go there for rescuing the king, for, if left unprotected, in battle, he will soon give up his life. Ye warriors of great energy, do, as I bid, even now. Ye sinless ones, make no delay. The combat deepens and becometh fierce, making the hair to stand on end. That commander of a division is high-born, endued with great bravery,\",\n",

The line occurs in Mann (Chap 1. 74 ) where ante refers to Brahmana's day and night. Vasishtha here refers to Mohapralaya and not any intermediate Pralaya. In the creation of Mahan or Prajapati or Virat, and of Consciousness, the element of Tamas or ignorance predominates. This is a very abstruse verse. I am not sure that I have understood it correctly, What is said here seems to be this from Akshara arose Hiranyagarbha: from Hiranyagarbha arose Virat. This, that or the other is worshipped by ordinary men, while persons possesse d of real insight do not invest any of them with attributes worthy of worship. The speaker says that the ascription of attributes, called Ignorance, and the non-ascription for destruction of that ascriptions called Knowledge, (with respect to Virat or Hira nyagarbha or Akshara) then arose. It might be asked that when there were no men as yet to worship or to condemn such worship, how could the two arise? The answer is that the two, in their subtile forms, came into existence and were after -wards availed of b y men when men come into being. From Akshara or the Indestructible is Hiranyagarbha. From Hiranyagarbha is Mahan or Virat and Consciousness. From the last are the subtile elements. The meanings of such verses depend upon the grammatical significations of certain words that are used. They can scarcely be rendered accurately into any other language not derived from Sanskrit. What is said here is that it is Prakriti which must be said to be the Adhishthatri of the universe. Vishnu is not so. Vish nu, Brahma, Akshara, or the Indestructible, however, is said to cover or _pervade_ the universe (vyapnoti). Vishnu is Vyapka but not Adhishthatri. In the previous section it has been said that through Tamas he takes birth among the intermediate orde rs, through Rajas among human beings, and through Sattwa among gods.

Surrounded by them all, as if by small animals struck with fear, thy son, unable to stay in their midst, moved away. Afflicted with hunger and thirst, and scorched by the sun, thy warriors, then, O Bharata, became exceedingly cheerless. Beholding the fall of Bharadwaja's son, which was like unto the dropping of the sun down upon the earth, or the drying up of the ocean, or the transplantation of Meru, or the defeat of Vasava, beholding that act, inca pable of being quietly witnessed, the Kauravas, O king, fled away in fear, --terror lending them greater speed. The ruler of the Gandharas Sakuni, beholding Drona of the golden car slain, fled with the car -warriors of his division, with speed that was much greater. Even the Suta's son fled away in fear, taking with him his own vast division, that was retreating with great speed with all its standards. The ruler of the Madras, viz., Salya, also, casting vacant looks around, fled away in fear, taking with him his division, teeming with cars and elephants and steeds. Saradwat's son, Kripa, too fled away, saying, 'Alas. Alas,' taking with him his division of elephants and foot-soldiers, the greater part thereof having been slain. Kritavarma, O king, also fled away, borne by his swift steeds, and surrounded by the remnant of his Bhoja, Kalinga, Aratta, and Valhika troops. Uluka, O king, beholding Drona slain, fled away with speed, afflicted with fear and accompanied by a large body of foot -soldiers. Handsome and endued with youth, and reputed for his bravery, Duhsasana, also, in great anxiety, fled away surrounded by his elephant division. Taking with him ten thousand cars and three thousand elephants, Vrishasena also fled with speed at the sight of Drona's fall. Accompanied by his elephants and horses and cars, and surrounded also by foot -soldiers, thy son, the mighty car -warrior, Duryodhana, too, fled away, O king, taking with him the remnant of the Samsaptakas whom Arjuna had not yet slaughtered. Susarman, O king, fled away, beholding Drona slain. Riding on elephants and cars and steeds, all the warriors of the Kaurava army fled away from the field, seeing Drona, of golden car, slain. Some urging their sires on, some their brothers, some their maternal uncles, some their sons, some their friends, the Kauravas fled away. Others urging on their brethren in arms or, their sisters' sons, their kinsmen, fled away on all sides. With dishevelled hair, and accoutrements loosened, all fled away in such a manner that even two persons could not be seen running together. --The Kuru army has been totally destroyed, --even this was the belief of everybody. Others amongst thy troops, fled away, O king, throwing off their coats of mail. The soldiers loudly called upon one another, O bull of Bharata's race, saying, --'Wait, Wait, do not fly,' but none of them that said so themselves stood on the field.

Beholding that elephant advancing, the mighty car-warriors of the Pandava army, placing Bhimasena at their head, themselves rushed towards it. Those warriors were the (five) Kekaya princes, and Abhimanyu, and the (five) sons of Draupadi and the heroic ruler of the Dasarnas, and Kshatradeva also, O sire, and the ruler of the Chedis, and Chitraketu. And all these mighty warriors came, inflamed with anger, and exhibiting their excellent celestial weapons. And they all surrounded in anger that single elephant (on which their adversary rode). Pierced with many shafts, that huge elephant, covered with gore flowing from his wounds, looked resplendent like a prince of mountain variegated with (liquified) red chalk (after a shower). The ruler of the Dasarnas then, on an elephant that resembled a mountain, rushed towards Bhagadatta's elephant. That prince of elephants, however, viz., Supratika, bore (the rush of) that advancing compeer like the continent bearing (the rush of) the surging sea. Beholding that elephant of the high souled king of the Dasarnas thus resisted, even the Pandava troops, applauding, cried out 'Excellent, excellent!' Then that best of kings, viz., the ruler of the Pragjyotishas, excited with rage, sped four and ten lances at that elephant. These, speedily penetrating through the excellent armour, decked with gold, that covered the animal's body, entered into it, like snakes entering anthills. Deeply pierced and exceedingly pained, that elephant, O chief of the Bharatas, its fury quelled, speedily turned back with great force. And it fled away with great swiftness, uttering frightful shrieks, and crushing the Pandava ranks like the tempest crushing trees with its violence. After that elephant was (thus) vanquished, the mighty car-warriors of the Pandava army, uttering loud leonine shouts, approached for battle. Placing Bhima at their head, they rushed at Bhagadatta scattering diverse kinds of arrows and diverse kinds of weapons. Hearing the fierce shouts, O king, of those advancing warriors swelling with rage and vengeance, that great bowman Bhagadatta, filled with rage and perfectly fearless, urged his own elephant. That prince of elephants then, thus urged with the hook and the toe, soon assumed the form of the (all-destructive) Samvarta fire (that appears at the end of the Yuga). Crushing crowds of cars and (hostile) compeers and steeds with riders, in that battle, it began, O king, to turn hither and thither. Filled with rage it also crushed foot-soldiers by hundreds and thousands. Attacked and agitated by that elephant, that large force of the Pandavas shrank in dimensions, O king, like a piece of leather exposed to the heat of fire. Beholding, then the Pandava array broken by the intelligent Bhagadatta, Ghatotkacha, of fierce mien, O king, with blazing face and eyes red as fire, filled with rage, rushed towards him. Assuming a terrible form and burning with wrath, he took up a bright dart capable of riving the very hills. Endued with great strength, he forcibly hurled that dart that emitted blazing flames from every part desirous of slaying that elephant. Beholding it coursing towards him with great impetuosity, the ruler of the Pragjyotishas sped at it a beautiful but fierce and sharp arrow with a crescent head. Possessed of great energy he cut off that dart with that arrow of his. Thereupon that dart, decked with gold, thus divided in twain, dropped down on the ground, like the bolt of heaven, hurled by Indra, flashing through the welkin. Beholding that dart (of his adversary), O king, divided in twain and fallen on the ground, Bhagadatta took up a large javelin furnished with a golden staff and resembling a flame of fire in effulgence, and hurled it at the Rakshasa, saying, 'Wait, Wait'. Seeing it coursing towards him like the bolt of heaven through the welkin, the Rakshasa jumped up and speedily seizing it uttered a loud shout. And quickly placing it against his knee, O Bharata, he broke it in the very sight of all the kings. All this seemed exceedingly wonderful. Beholding that feat achieved by the mighty Rakshasa, the celestials in the firmament, with the Gandharvas and the Munis, were filled with wonder. And the Pandava warriors also, headed by Bhimasena, filled the earth with cries of 'Excellent, Excellent'. Hearing, however, those loud shouts of the rejoicing Pandavas, that great bowman, viz., the valiant Bhagadatta, could not bear it (coolly). Drawing his large bow whose effulgence resembled that of Indra's bolt, he roared with great energy at the mighty car-warriors of the Pandava army, shooting at the same time many bright arrows of great sharpness and possessed of the effulgence of fire. And he pierced Bhima with one arrow, and the Rakshasa with nine. And he pierced Abhimanyu with three, and the Kekaya brothers with five. And with another straight arrow shot from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch, he pierced, in that battle, the right arm of Kshatradeva. Thereupon the latter's bow with arrow fixed on the bowstring dropped down from his hand. And he struck the five sons of Draupadi with five arrows. And from wrath, he slew the steeds of Bhimasena. And with three shafts winged with feathers, he cut down Bhimasena's standard bearing the device of a lion. And with three other shafts he pierced Bhima's charioteer. Deeply pierced by Bhagadatta in that battle, and exceedingly pained, Visoka thereupon, O chief of the Bharatas, sat down on the terrace of the car. Then, O king, that foremost of car-warriors, viz., Bhima, thus deprived of his car, quickly jumped down from his large vehicle taking up his mace. Beholding him with mace upraised and looking like a crested hill, all thy troops, O Bharata, became filled with great fear. Just at this time that son of Pandu who had Krishna for his charioteer, O king, slaughtering the foe on all sides as he came, appeared at that spot where those tigers among men, those mighty car-warriors, viz., Bhimasena and Ghatotkacha, sire and son, were engaged with the ruler of the Pragjyotishas. Beholding his brothers, those mighty car-warriors, engaged in battle, that son of Pandu quickly commenced to fight, profusely scattering his shafts, O chief of the Bharatas. Then that mighty car-warrior, viz., king Duryodhana, speedily urged on a division of his troops abounding with cars and elephants. Towards that mighty division of the Kauravas thus advancing with impetuosity, Arjuna of white steeds rushed with great impetuosity. Bhagadatta also, upon that elephant of his, O Bharata, crushing the Pandava ranks, rushed towards Yudhishthira. Then commenced a fierce battle between Bhagadatta, O sire, and the Panchalas, the Srinjayas, and the Kekayas, with upraised weapons. Then Bhimasena, in that battle told both Kesava and Arjuna in detail about the slaughter of Iravat as it had occurred.\",\n",

This wicked son of Dhr itarashtra, this one unacquainted  with the true means (of accomplishing his objects), this fool that is  wrongly vain of his sovereignty, obeyeth only the dictates of wrath and  avarice. I see also, O Janardana, that the hour of all those Kshatriyas  is arriv ed, for all those kings, from delusion, have with their  counsellors followed Duryodhana.' Hearing these words of Bhishma, the  lotus -eyed hero of Dasarha's race, possessed of great powers, addressing  all those (that were still there) headed by Bhishma and D rona, said,  'Even this is great transgression, of which all the elders of the Kuru  race are becoming guilty, for they do not forcibly seize and bind this  wicked king in the enjoyment of sovereignty. Ye chastiser of foes, I  think the time hath come for doin g this. If this is done, it may still be  productive of good. Listen to me, ye sinless ones. The words I will speak  will soon lead to beneficial results, if, indeed, ye  Bharatas, ye accept  what I say in consequence of its recommending itself to you. The wicked son, of ill -regulated soul, of the old Bhoja king, having usurped his  father's sovereignty during the latter's life -time, subjected himself to  death. Indeed, Kansa, the son of Ugrasena, abandoned by his relatives,  was slain by me in a great encounter, from desire of benefiting my  kinsmen. Ourselves with our kinsmen then, having paid due honours to  Ugrasena, the son of Ahuka, installed that extender of Bhoja's  kingdom on  the throne. And all the Yadavas and Andhakas and the Vrishnis, abandoning  a single p erson, viz., Kansa for the  sake of their whole race, have  prospered and obtained happiness. O king, when the gods and Asuras were  arrayed for battle and weapons were upraised for striking, the lord of  all creatures, Parameshthin said thus (something which applies to the  case at hand). Indeed, O Bharata, when the population of the worlds was  divided into two parties and was about to be slaughtered, the divine and  holy Cause of the universe, viz., the Creator, said, 'The Asuras and the  Daityas with the Danava s will be  vanquished, and the Adityas, the Vasus,  the Rudras and other dwellers of heaven will be victorious. Indeed, the  gods, and Asuras, and human beings, and Gandharvas, and Snakes, and  Rakshasas, will in rage slaughter one another in this battle.' Thinking  so, the Lord of all creatures, Parameshthin, commanded Dharma, saying,  'Binding fast, the Daityas and the Danavas, make them over to Varuna.'  Thus addressed, Dharma, at the command of Parameshthin, binding the  Daityas and the Danavas,  made them over to Varuna. And Varuna, the Lord  of the waters, having bound those Danavas, with Dharma's noose, as also  with his own, keepeth them within the depths of the ocean, always  guarding them carefully. Binding in the same way  Duryodhana and Karna and  Sakuni, the son of Suvala, and Dussasana, make them over to the Pandavas.  For the sake of a  family, an individual may be sacrificed. For a village,  a family may be sacrificed. For the sake of a province, a village may be  sacrificed. And lastly, for the sake of one's s elf, the whole earth may  be sacrificed.

His weapons are fierce, and the prowess also of that high -souled one is fierce. Relying upon Karna, king Duryodhana had set his heart o n battle. Beholding Duryodhana deeply afflicted by the son of Pandu, and seeing also the sons of Pandu displaying great prowess, what did that mighty car -warrior, viz., Karna, do? Alas, the foolish Duryodhana, relying on Karna, hopeth to vanquish the Parth as with their sons and Keshava in battle! ```',\n",

I know all that thou hast said unto me. Morally, I am the son of Pandu, as also in consequence of the injunctions of the scriptures, as thou, O Krishna, thinkest. My mother, while a maiden, bore me in her womb, O Janardana, through her connection with Surya. And at the command of Surya himself, she abandoned me as soon as I was born. Even thus, O Krishna, I came into the world. Morally, therefore, I am the son of Pandu. Kunti, however, abandoned me without thinking of my welfare. The Suta, Adhiratha, as soon as he beheld me, took me to his home, and from her affection for me, Radha's breasts were filled with milk that very day, and she, O Madhava, cleansed my urine and evacuations. How can one like us, conversant with duties and ever engaged in listening to scriptures deprive her of her Pinda? So also Adhiratha of the Suta class regardeth me as a son, and I too, from affection, always regard him as (my) father. O Madhava, that Adhiratha, O Janardana, from paternal affection caused all the rites of infancy to be performed on my person, according to the rules prescribed in the scriptures. It is that Adhiratha, again, who caused the name Vasusena to be bestowed upon me by the Brahmanas. When also I attained to youth, I married wives according to his selections. Through them have been born my sons and grandsons, O Janardana. My heart also, O Krishna, and all the bonds of affection and love, are fixed on them. From joy or fear. O Govinda. I cannot venture to destroy those bonds even for the sake of the whole earth or heaps of gold. In consequence also of my connection with Duryodhana of Dhritarashtra's race, I have, O Krishna, enjoyed sovereignty for thirteen years, without a thorn on my side. I have performed many sacrifices, always however in connection with persons of the Suta tribe. All my family rites and marriage rites have been performed with the Sutas. Obtaining me, O Krishna, Duryodhana hath, O thou of Vrishni's race, made this preparations for an armed encounter and provoked hostilities with the sons of Pandu. And it is for this, O Achyuta, that in the battle (that will ensue), I, O Krishna, have been chosen as the great antagonist of Arjuna to advance against him in a single combat. For the sake of death, or the ties of blood, or fear, or temptation, I cannot venture, O Janardana, to behave falsely towards the intelligent son of Dhritarashtra. If I do not now engage in a single combat with Arjuna, this will, O Hrishikesa, be inglorious for both myself and Partha. Without doubt, O slayer of Madhu, thou hast told me all this for doing me good. The Pandavas also, obedient as they are to thee, will, without doubt, do all that thou hast said. Thou must, however, conceal this our discourse for the present, O slayer of Madhu. Therein lies our benefit, I think, O delighter of all the Yadavas. If king Yudhishthira, of virtuous soul and well-controlled senses, cometh to know me as the firstborn son of Kunti, he will never accept the kingdom. If, again, O slayer of Madhu, this mighty and swelling empire becometh mine. I shall, O repressor of foes, certainly make it over to Duryodhana only. Let Yudhishthira of virtuous soul become king for ever. He that hath Hrishikesa for his guide, and Dhananjaya and that mighty car-warrior Bhima for his combatants, as also Nakula and Sahadeva, and the sons of Draupadi, is fit, O Madhava, to rule over the whole earth.

One day, that lady of beautiful face, unrivalled in the universe for beauty of form, came to me, O goddess, for circumambulating me but really impelled by the desire of tempting me. In whatever direction that lady of beautiful teeth turned, a new face of mine instantly appeared (so eager did I become to see her). All those faces of mine became agreeable to look at. Thus, in consequence of the desire of beholding her, I became four-faced, through Yoga-puissance, Thus, I showed my high Yoga-power in becoming four-faced. With that face of mine which is turned towards the east, I exercise the sovereignty of the universe, With that face of mine which is turned towards the north, I sport with thee, O thou of faultless features! That face of mine which is turned towards the west is agreeable and auspicious. With it I ordain the happiness of all creatures. That face of mine which is turned towards the south is terrible. With it I destroy all creatures. I live as a Brahmacharin with matted locks on my head, impelled by the desire of doing good to all creatures. The bow Pinaka is always in my hand for accomplishing the purposes of the deities. In days of yore, Indra, desirous of acquiring my prosperity, had hurled his thunderbolt at me. With that weapon my throat was scorched. For this reason I have become blue-throated.' Uma said, 'When, O foremost of all creatures, there are so many excellent vehicles endued with great beauty, why is it that thou hast selected a bovine bull for thy vehicle?' Maheswara said, 'In the days of yore, the Grandsire Brahma created the celestial cow Surabhi yielding abundant milk. After her creation there sprang from her a large number of kine all of which yielded copious quantities of milk sweet as nectar. Once on a time a quantity of froth fell from the mouth of one of her calves on my body. I was enraged at this and my wrath scorched all the kine which thereupon became diversified in hue. I was then pacified by the Master of all the worlds, viz., Brahma, conversant with all topics. It was he who gave me this bull both as a vehicle for bearing me and as a device on my banner.' Uma said, 'Thou hast many abodes in heaven, of diverse forms and possessed of every comfort and luxury. Why, O holy one, dost thou reside in the crematorium, abandoning all those delightful mansions? The crematorium is full of the hair and bones of the dead, abounds with vulture and jackals, and is strewn with hundreds of funeral pyres. Full of carrion and muddy with fat and blood, with entrails and bones strewn all over it, and always echoing with the howls of jackals, it is certainly an unclean place.' Maheswara said, 'I always wander over the whole earth in search of a sacred spot. I do not, however, see any spot that is more sacred than the crematorium. Hence, of all abodes, the crematorium pleases my heart most, shaded that it generally is by branches of the banyan and adorned with torn garlands of flowers. O thou of sweet smiles, the multitudes of ghostly beings that are my companions love to reside in such spots. I do not like, O goddess, to reside anywhere without those ghostly creatures being by my side. Hence, the crematorium is a sacred abode to me. Indeed, O auspicious lady, it seems to me to be the very heaven. Highly sacred and possessed of great merit, the crematorium is much applauded by persons desirous of having holy abodes.' Uma said, 'O holy one, O lord of all creatures, O foremost of all observers of duties and religious rites, I have a great doubt, O wielder of Pinaka, O giver of boons. These ascetics, O puissant lord, have undergone diverse kinds of austerities. In the world are seen ascetics wandering everywhere under diverse forms and clad in diverse kinds of attire. For benefiting this large assemblage of Rishis, as also myself, do thou kindly resolve, O chastiser of all foes, this doubt of mine. What indications has Religion or Duty been said to possess? How, indeed, do men become unacquainted with the details of Religion or Duty to succeed in observing them? O puissant lord, O thou that art conversant with Religion, do thou tell me this.' Narada continued, 'When the daughter of Himavat put this question, conclave of Rishis there present worshipped the goddess and adored her with words adorned with Riks and with hymns fraught with deep import.' Maheswara said, 'Abstention from injury, truthfulness of speech, compassion towards all beings, tranquillity of soul, and the making of gifts to the best of one's power, are the foremost duties of the householder. Abstention from sexual congress with the spouses of other men, protection of the wealth and the woman committed to one's charge, unwillingness to appropriate what is not given to one, and avoidance of honey and meat, --these are the five chief duties. Indeed, Religion or Duty has many branches all of which are fraught with happiness. Even these are the duties which these embodied creatures who regard duty as superior should observe and practise. Even these are the sources of merit.' Uma said, O holy one, I wish to ask thee another question about which I have great doubts. It behoveth thee to answer it and dispel my doubts. What are the meritorious duties of the four several orders? What duties appertain to the Brahmana? What to the Kshatriya? What are the indications of those duties that appertain to the Vaisya?

Overwhelmed with sorrow, and burning with grief, that bull of Bharata's race once more enquired of his charioteer Sanjaya, the son of Gavalgana, the details of what had happened.'\\n\\n'Dhritarashtra said, 'After Bhishma and Drona had been slain, and the Suta's son also overthrown, whom did my warriors make their generalissimo? The Pandavas are slaying without any delay everyone whom my warriors are making their generalissimo in battle.

Even thus was the Suta's son, that valiant Karna, slain by Arjuna in the sight of all the kings. Long before, the high-souled Vidura had told me that through the fault of Duryodhana the population of the Earth would be exterminated. There are some fools that do not see things even though they cast their eyes on them. Those words of Vidura have been even so unto my foolish self. What Vidura of righteous soul, conversant with attributes of everything, then said, hath turned out exactly, for the words he uttered were nothing but the truth. Afflicted by fate, I did not then act according to those words. The fruits of that evil course have now manifested themselves. Describe them to me, O son of Gavalgana, once more!

Who were they that protected the right wheel of the ruler of the Madras in battle? Who protected the left wheel of that hero when he went to battle? Who also guarded his rear? How, when all of you were together, could the mighty king of the Madras, as also my son, be slain, O Sanjaya, by the Pandavas? Tell me the details of the great destruction of the Bharatas. Tell me how my son Duryodhana fell in battle. Tell me how all the Pancalas with their followers, and Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi and the five sons of Draupadi, fell.

I desire to hear everything about the manner in which the battle occurred and the kind of battle it was. Thou art skilled, O Sanjaya, in narration. Tell me everything.'\\n\\n'Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, with attention, how that great carnage of the Kurus and the Pandavas occurred when they encountered each other. After the Suta's son had been slain by the illustrious son of Pandu, and after thy troops had been repeatedly rallied and had repeatedly fled away, and after a terrible carnage had taken place, O foremost of men, of human beings in battle subsequent to Karna's death, Partha began to utter leonine roars. At that time a great fear entered the hearts of thy sons. Indeed, after Karna's death, there was no warrior in thy army who could set his heart upon rallying the troops or displaying his prowess. They then looked like ship-wrecked merchants on the fathomless ocean without a raft to save themselves. When their protector was slain by the diadem-decked Arjuna, they were like persons on the wide sea desirous of reaching some shore of safety. Indeed, O king, after the slaughter of the Suta's son, thy troops, struck with panic and mangled with arrows, were like unprotected men desirous of a protector or like a herd of deer afflicted by a lion. Vanquished by Savyasaci, they retired in the evening like bulls with broken horns or snakes shorn of their fangs. Their foremost of heroes slain, themselves thrown into confusion and mangled with keen arrows, thy sons, O king, upon the slaughter of the Suta's son, fled away in fear. Deprived of weapons and coats of mail, all of them lost their senses and knew not in which direction to fly. Casting their eyes on all sides in fear, many of them began to slaughter one another. Many fell down or became pale, thinking, 'It is me whom Vibhatsu is pursuing!' 'It is me whom Vrikodara is pursuing!' Some riding on fleet steeds, some on fleet cars, and some on fleet elephants, many great car-warriors fled away from fear, abandoning the foot-soldiers. Cars were broken by elephants, horsemen were crushed by great car-warriors, and bands of foot-soldiers were smashed and slain by bodies of horses as these fled away from the field. After the fall of the Suta's son, thy troops became like stragglers from a caravan in a forest abounding with robbers and beasts of prey. Some elephants whose riders had been slain, and others whose trunks had been cut off, afflicted with fear, beheld the whole world to be full of Partha.

Equal to ten  courtezans is a single (territorial) chief.[540] A great king is said  to be equal to half of these all. Hence, one should not accept, gifts from  these. On the other hand, one should attend to the science, that is  sacred and that has righteousness for its indications, of the aggregate  of three (viz., Religion, Wealth, and Pleasure). Amongst these, Wealth  and Pleasure are naturally attractive. Hence, one should, with  concentrated attention, listen to the sacred expositions of Religion (in  particular), for the fruits are very great of listening to the mysteries  of Religion. One should certainly hear every topic connected with  Religion as ordained by the deities themselves. In it is contained the ritual in respect of the Sraddha in which have been declared the  mysteries connected with the Pitris. The mysteries connected with all the deities have also been explained there. It comprehends the duties and  practices, productive of great merit, of the Rishis also, together with the mysteries attaching to them. It contains an exposition of the merits of great sacrifices and those that attach to all kinds of gifts. Those men who always read the scriptures bearing on these topics, those who bear them properly in their mind, and he who, having listened to them, follows them in practice, are all regarded to be as holy and sinless as the puissant Narayana himself. The merits that attach to the gift of kine, those that belong to the performance of ablutions in sacred waters, those that are won by the performance of sacrifices, --all these are acquired by that man who treats guests with reverence.

Dhritarashtra with his sons is now looking for an extensive and undisputed sovereignty over the whole world. Absolute peace is, therefore, unattainable.

There where the rays of the Sun and the Moon cannot reach are luminaries[552] which are self -effulgent and which possess splendour like that of the Sun or the fire. Know this, O giver of honours, that possessed of far -famed splendour, even these last do not behold the limits of the firmament in consequence of the inaccessibility and infinity of those limits. This Space which the very gods cannot measure is fall of many blazing and self-luminous worlds each above the other. Beyond the limits of land are oceans of water. Beyond water is darkness. Beyond darkness is water again, and beyond the last is fire. Downwards, beyond the nether regions, is water. Beyond water is the region belonging to the great snakes. Beyond that is sky once more, and beyond the sky is water again. Even thus there is water and sky alternately without end. Even such are the limits of the Divinity represented by water. The very gods are unable to ascertain limits of fire and wind and water. The nature of fire, wind, water, and land, is like that of space. They are distinguished through want of true Knowledge. Sages read in diverse scriptures the limits that have been declared of the three worlds and the ocean. Who is there, however, that would set limits to what cannot be grasped by vision and what is inaccessible (in all its parts)? If even it becomes possible to ascertain the limits of the firmament which is the track of the gods and beings crowned with ascetic success, it can never be possible to set limits to that which is limitless and known by the name of the Infinite, to that which correspond with the name by which it is known, viz., what has been called the high -souled Manasa? When again His form is sometimes contracted and sometimes expanded, how can any one else except one that is equal to Him, be able to comprehend His limits?

One's righteousness is never destroyed as long as one cherishes the inclination of making gifts. Disregarding filial affection, disregarding the affection one feels for one's wife, and reckoning righteousness as the foremost, thou hast paid no heed to the cravings of nature. The acquisition of wealth is an act of slight merit. Its gift to a deserving person is fraught with greater merit. Of still greater merit is the (proper) time. Lastly, devotion (in the matter of gift) is fraught with the highest merit. The door of Heaven is very difficult to see. Through heedlessness men fail to obtain a sight of it. The bar of Heaven's door has cupidity for its seed. That bar is kept fastened by desire and affection. Verily, Heaven's door is unapproachable. Those men who subdued wrath and conquered their passions, those Brahmanas who are endued with penances and who make gifts according to the measure of their ability, succeed in beholding it. It has been said that he that gives away a hundred, having a thousand, he that gives away ten, having a hundred, and he that gives a handful of water, having no wealth, are all equal in respect of the merit they earn. King Rantideva, when divested of all his wealth, gave a small quantity of water with a pure heart. Through this gift, O learned Brahmana, he went to Heaven. The deity of righteousness is never gratified so much with large gifts of costly things as with gifts of even things of no value, if acquired lawfully and given away with devotion and faith. King Nriga had made gifts of thousands of kine unto the regenerate class. By giving away only one cow that did not belong to him, he fell into Hell. Usinara's son Sivi of excellent vows, by giving away the flesh of his own body, is rejoicing in Heaven, having attained to the regions of the righteous. Mere wealth is not merit. Good men acquire merit by exerting to the best of their power and with the aid of pious meals. One does not acquire such merit by means of even diverse sacrifices as with even a little wealth that has been earned lawfully. Through wrath, the fruits of gifts are destroyed. Through cupidity one fails to go to Heaven. One conversant with the merits of gift, and leading a just course of conduct succeeds, through penances, in enjoying Heaven. The fruit, O Brahmana, of this gift made by thee (of a prastha of powdered barley) is much greater than what one acquires by many Rajasuya sacrifices with profuse gifts or many Horse-sacrifices. With this prastha of powdered barley thou hast conquered the eternal region of Brahman. Go thou in happiness, O learned Brahmana, to the abode of Brahman that is without the stain of darkness. O foremost of regenerate persons, a celestial car is here for all of you. Do thou ascend it as pleasest thee, O Brahmana, I am the deity of Righteousness. Behold me! Thou hast rescued thy body. The fame of thy achievement will last in the world. With thy wife, thy son, and thy daughter-in-law, go now to Heaven.' --After the deity of Righteousness had said these words, that Brahmana, with his wife, son, daughter-in-law, proceeded to Heaven. After that learned Brahmana, conversant with all duties, had thus ascended to Heaven with his son, daughter-in-law, and wife numbering the fourth, I came out of my hole. There with the scent of that powdered barley, with the mire caused by the water (which the Brahmana had given to his guest), with the contact (of my body) with the celestial flowers that had been rained down, with the particles of the barley-powder which that good man had given away, and the penances of that Brahmana, my head became gold, Behold, in consequence of the gift of that Brahmana who was firm in truth, and his penances, half of this my ample body has become golden. Ye regenerate ones, for converting the rest of my body into gold I repeatedly repair, with a cheerful heart, to the retreats of ascetics and the sacrifices performed by kings. Hearing of this sacrifice of the Kuru king endued with great wisdom, I came hither with high hopes. I have not, however, been made gold. Ye foremost of Brahmanas, it was for this that I uttered those words, viz., that this sacrifice can by no means compare with (the gift of) that prastha of powdered barley. With the grains of that prastha of powdered barley, I was made gold on that occasion. This great sacrifice however, is not equal to those grains. Even this is my opinion.' Having said those words unto all those foremost of Brahmanas, the mongoose disappeared from their sight. Those Brahmanas then returned to their respective homes.'\",\n",

He, however, who is conversant with the true meaning of a treatise, is said to have studied that treatise to purpose. Questioned regarding the meaning of a text, it behoveth one to communicate that meaning which he has comprehended by a careful study. That person of dull intelligence who refuses to expound the meanings of texts in the midst of a conclave of the learned, that person of foolish understanding, never succeeds in expounding the meaning correctly. An ignorant person, going to expound the true meaning of treatises, incurs ridicule. Even those possessed of a knowledge of the Soul have to incur ridicule on such occasions (if what they go to explain has not been acquired by study). Listen now to me, O monarch, as to how the subject of Emancipation has been explained (by preceptors to disciple from days of old) among highsouled persons conversant with the Sankhya and the Yoga systems of philosophy. That which the Yogin, behold is precisely that which the Sankhyas arrive after to attain. He who sees the Sankhya and the Yoga systems to be one and the same is said to be endued with intelligence. Skin, flesh, blood, fat, bile, marrow, and sinews, and these senses (of both knowledge and action), about which thou wert speaking unto me, exist. Objects flow from objects; the senses from the senses. From body one obtains a body, as a seed is obtained from seed. When the Supreme Being is without senses, without seed, without matter, without body, He must be divested of all attributes! and in consequence of His being so, how, indeed, can He have attributes of any kind? Space and other attributes arise from the attributes of Sattwa and Rajas and Tamas, and disappear ultimately in them. Thus the attributes arise from Prakriti. Skin, flesh, blood, fat, bile, marrow, bones, and sinews, --these eight that are made of Prakriti, know, O king, may sometimes be produced by the vital seed alone (of the male). The Jiva-soul and the universe are said to both partake of Prakriti characterised by the three attributes of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas. The Supreme Soul is different from both the Jiva-soul and the universe. As the seasons though unendued with forms, are nevertheless inferred from the appearance of particular fruits and flowers, after the same manner, Prakriti, though formless, is inferred from the attributes of Mahat and the rest that spring from it. In this way from the existence of Chaitanya in the body, the Supreme Soul, divested of all attributes whatever and perfectly stainless, is inferred. Without beginning and destruction, without end, the overseer of all things, and auspicious, that Soul, only in consequence of its identifying itself with the body and other attributes, comes to be taken as invested with attributes. Those persons that are truly conversant with attributes know that only objects endued with attributes can have attributes but that That which transcends all attributes can have none. When the Jiva-soul conquers all attributes born of Prakriti and which it assumes under error, only then does it behold the Supreme Soul. Only the highest Rishis conversant with the Sankhya and the Yoga systems know that Supreme Soul which Sankhya and Yogins and believers in all other systems say is beyond the Understanding, which is regarded as Knower and endued with the highest wisdom in consequence of its casting off all consciousness of identification with Prakriti, which transcends the attribute of Ignorance or Error, which is Unmanifest, which is beyond all attributes, which is called the Supreme, which is dissociated from all attributes, which ordains all things, which is Eternal and Immutable, which overrules Prakriti and all the attributes born of Prakriti, and which, transcending the four and twenty topics of enquiry, forms the twenty-fifth. When men of knowledge, who stand in fear of birth, of the several conditions of living consciousness, and of death, succeed in knowing the Unmanifest, they succeed in understanding the Supreme Soul at the same time. An intelligent man regards the unity of Jiva-soul with the Supreme Soul as consistent with the scriptures and as perfectly correct, while the man destitute of intelligence looks upon the two as different from each other. This forms the distinction between the man of intelligence and man that is destitute of it. The indications of both Kshara and Akshara (destructible and indestructible) have now been said unto thee. Akshara is Oneness or Unity, while multiplicity or variety is said to be Kshara. When one begins to study and understands properly the five and twenty topics of enquiry, one then comprehends that the Oneness of the Soul is consistent with the scriptures and its multiplicity is what is opposed to them. These are the several indications of what is included in the tale of topics or principles created and what transcends that tale. The wise have said that the tale of topics numbers only five and twenty. That which transcends the topics is beyond that number and forms the twenty-sixth. The study or comprehension of created things (numbered five and twenty) according to their aggregates (of five) is the study and comprehension of topics. Transcending these is That which is eternal.'\",\n",

On the other hand, the materialist acquireth merit (by action) and ( as the consequence thereof) emancipation. He hath also (in course of his pursuit) to incur sin. Having obtained again fruits of both virtue and vice which are transitory, (heaven having its end as also hell in respect of the virtuous and the sinful), the man of action becometh once more addicted to action as the consequence of his own previous virtues and vices. The man of action, however, who possesseth intelligence, destroyeth his sins by his virtuous acts. Virtue, therefore, is strong, and hence the success of the man of action.\\'  \\n\\n\"Dhritarashtra said, \\'Tell me, according to their gradation, of those eternal regions that are said to be attainable, as the fruits of their own virtuous acts, by regenerate persons, engaged in the practice of virtue.

In the country lying between the rivers Ganga and Yamuna, at the foot of the hills called Yamuna, there was a large town inhabited by Brahmanas. The town was celebrated under the name of Parnasala and was very delightful in appearance, O king. A large number of learned Brahmanas lived in it. One day, Yama, the ruler of the dead, commanded a messenger of his, who was clad in black, endued with blood-red eyes and hair standing erect, and possessed of feet, eyes, and nose all of which resembled those of a crow, saying, \\'Go thou to the town inhabited by Brahmanas and bring hither the person known by the name of Sarmin and belonging by birth to the race of Agastya. He is intent on mental tranquillity and possessed of learning. He is a preceptor engaged in teaching the Vedas and his practices are well-known. Do not bring me another person belonging to the same race and living in the same neighbourhood. This other man is equal unto him I want, in virtues, study, and birth. With respect to children and conduct, this other resembles the intelligent Sarmin. Do thou bring the individual I have in view. He should be worshipped with respect (instead of being dragged hither with irreverence).\\' The messenger having come to the place, did the very reverse of what he had been bidden to do. Attacking that person, he brought him who had been forbidden by Yama to be brought. Possessed of great energy, Yama rose up at the sight of the Brahmana and worshipped him duly. The king of the dead then commanded his messenger, saying, \\'Let this one be taken back, and let the other one be brought to me.\\' When the great judge of the dead said these words, that Brahmana addressed him and said, \\'I have completed my study of the Vedas and am no longer attached to the world. Whatever period may yet remain of my mortal existence, I wish to pass, dwelling even here, O thou of unfading glory![346]\"\\n\\n\"Yama said, \\'I cannot ascertain the exact period, ordained by Time, of one\\'s life, and hence, unurged by Time, I cannot allow one to take up one\\'s residence here. I take note of the acts of righteousness (or otherwise) that one does in the world. Do thou, O learned Brahmana of great splendour return immediately to thy abode. Tell me what also is in thy mind and what I can do for thee, O thou of unfading glory!\\'\\n\\n\"The Brahmana said, \\'Do thou tell me what those acts are by accomplishing which one may earn great merit. O best of all beings, thou art the foremost of authorities (on the subject) even in the three worlds.\\'\\n\\n\"Yama said, \\'Do thou hear, O regenerate Rishi, the excellent ordinances regarding gifts. The gift of sesame seeds is a very superior one. It produces everlasting merit. O foremost of regenerate ones, one should make gifts of as much sesame as one can. By making gifts of sesame every day, one is sure to attain the fruition of one\\'s every wish. The gift of sesame at Sraddhas is applauded. Verily the gift of sesame is a very superior one. Do thou make gifts of sesame unto the Brahmanas according to the rites ordained in the scriptures. One should on the day of the full moon of the month of Vaisakha, make gifts of sesame unto the Brahmanas. They should also be made to eat and to touch sesame on every occasion that one can afford. They that are desirous of achieving what is beneficial to them should, with their whole souls, do this in their houses.[347] Without doubt, men should similarly make gifts of water and establish resting places for the distribution of drinking water.[348] One should cause tanks and lakes and wells to be excavated. Such acts are rare in the world, O best of regenerate persons! Do thou always make gifts of water. This act is fraught with great merit. O best of regenerate persons, thou shouldst establish resting places along the roads for the distribution of water. After one has eaten, the gift unto one should especially be made of water for drink.\\'\\n\\n\"Bhishma continued, \\'After Yama had said these words unto him, the messenger who had borne him from his abode conveyed him back to it. The Brahmana, on his return, obeyed the instructions he had received. Having thus conveyed him back to his abode the messenger of Yama fetched Sarmin who had really been sought by Yama. Taking Sarmin unto him, he informed his master. Possessed of great energy, the judge of the dead worshipped that righteous Brahmana, and having conversed with him a while dismissed him for being taken back to his abode. Unto him also Yama gave the same instructions. Sarmin, too, coming back into the world of men, did all that Yama had said. Like the gift of water, Yama, from a desire of doing good to the Pitris, applauds the gift of lamps to light dark places. Hence, the giver of a lamp for lighting a dark place is regarded as benefiting the Pitris. Hence, O best of the Bharatas, one should always give lamps for lighting dark spots. The giving of lamps enhances the visual power of the deities, the Pitris, and one\\'s own self.[349] It has been said, O king, that the gift of gems is a very superior gift. The Brahmana, who, having accepted a gift of gems, sells the same for performing a sacrifice, incurs no fault. The Brahmana, who, having accepted a gift of gems makes a gift of them unto Brahmanas. acquires inexhaustible merit himself and confers inexhaustible merit upon him from whom he had originally received them. Conversant with every duty Manu himself has said that he, who, observant of proper restraints, earns makes a gift of gems unto a Brahmana observant of proper restraints earns inexhaustible merit himself and confers inexhaustible merit upon the recipient. The man who is content with his own wedded wife and who makes a gift of robes, earns an excellent complexion and excellent vestments for himself.

These and many other Kshatriyas, approaching that high-souled bull among the Kshatriyas, sat down on excellent seats. Those mighty and high-souled heroes of great splendour viz., Krishna and Yuyudhana, both sat on the same seat. Then in the hearing of them all, Yudhishthira addressing the lotus-eyed slayer of Madhu, and said unto him these sweet words: 'Relying on thee alone, we, like the celestial one, the deity of a thousand eyes, seek, victory in battle and eternal happiness. Thou art aware, O Krishna, of the deprivation of our kingdom, our exile at the hands of the foe, and all our diverse woes. O lord of all, O thou that are compassionate unto those that are devoted to thee, upon thee wholly rests the happiness of us all and our very existence, O slayer of Madhu! O thou of Vrishni's race, do that by which my heart may ever rest on thee! Do also that, O Lord, by which the proposed vow of Arjuna may be realised. O, rescue us today from this ocean of grief and rage. O Madhava, become thou today a boat unto us that are desirous of crossing (that ocean). The car-warriors desirous of slaying the foe cannot, in battle, do that (for the success of his object) which, O Krishna, the car-driver can do, if he exerts himself carefully. O Janardana, as thou always savest the Vrishnis in all calamities, even so it behoveth thee to save us from this distress, O mighty-armed one! O bearer of the conch, discus, and mace, rescue the sons of Pandu sunk in the fathomless and boatless Kuru-ocean, by becoming a boat unto them. I bow to thee, O God of the lord of the gods, O thou that are eternal, O supreme Destroyer, O Vishnu, O Jishnu, O Hari, O Krishna, O Vaikuntha, O best of mate beings! Narada described thee as that ancient and best of Rishis (called Narayana) that giveth boons, that beareth the bow Saranga, and that is the foremost of all. O Madhava, make those words true. Thus addressed in the midst of that assembly by king Yudhishthira the just, Kesava, that foremost of speakers, replied unto Yudhishthira in a voice deep as that of clouds charged with rain, saying, 'In all the worlds including that of the celestials, there is no bowman equal to Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha! Possessed of great energy. accomplished in weapons, of great prowess and great strength, celebrated in battle, ever wrathful, and of great energy, Arjuna is the foremost of men. Youthful in years bull-necked, and of long arms, he is endued with great strength. Treading like a lion or a bull, and exceedingly beautiful he will slay all thy foes. As regards myself, I will do that by which Arjuna, the son of Kunti, may be able to consume the troops of Dhritarashtra's son like a swelling conflagration. This very day, Arjuna will, by his arrows despatch that vile wretch of sinful deeds, that slayer of Subhadra's son, (viz., Jayadratha), to that road from which no traveller comes back. Today vultures and hawks and furious jackals and other carnivorous creatures will feed on his flesh. O Yudhishthira, if even all the gods with Indra become his protectors today, Jayadratha will still, slain in the thick of battle, repair to Yama's capital . Having slain the ruler of the Sindhus, Jishnu will come to thee (in the evening). Dispel thy grief and the fever (of thy heart), O king, and be thou graced with prosperity.'\",\n",

Alas, we could not protect today the son of even such a person from danger.

Worshipping him duly, and causing him to be seated, Yudhishthira, afflicted with grief on account of the death of his brother\\'s son, said, \\'Alas, while battling with many mighty bowmen, the son of Subhadra, surrounded by several great car - warriors of unrighteous propensities, hath been slain on the field. The slayer of hostile heroes, the son of Subhadra, was a child in years and of childish understanding.[82] He fought in battle against desperate odds. I asked him to open a passage for us in battle. He penetrated within the hostile army, but we could not follow him, obstructed by the ruler of the Sindhus. Alas, they that betake themselves to battle as a profession, always fight with antagonists equally circumstanced with themselves. This battle, however, that the enemy fought with Abhimanyu, was an extremely unequal one. It is that which grieves me greatly and draws tears from me. Thinking of this, I fail to regain peace of mind.\\' \"Sanjaya continued, \\'The illustrious Vyasa, addressing Yudhishthira who was indulging in such lamentations and who was thus unmanned by an accession of sorrow, said these words.\\' \"Vyasa said, \\'O Yudhishthira, O thou of great wisdom, O thou that art master of all branches of knowledge, persons like thee never suffer themselves to be stupefied by calamities. This brave youth, having slain numerous foes hath ascended to heaven. Indeed, that best of persons, (though a child), acted, however, like one of matured years. O Yudhishthira, this law is incapable of being transgressed. O Bharata, Death takes all viz., Gods and Dhanavas and Gandharvas (without exception).\\' \"Yudhishthira said, \\'Alas, these lords of earth, that lie on the bare earth, slain in the midst of their forces, bereft of consciousness, were possessed of great might. Others (of their class) possessed strength equal to that of ten thousand elephants. Others, again, were endued with the impetuosity and might of the very wind. They have all perished in battle, slain by men of their own class. I do not behold the person (save one of their own class) who could slay any of them in battle. Endued with great prowess, they were possessed of great energy and great might. Alas, they who used daily to come to battle with this hope firmly implanted in their hearts, viz., that they would conquer, alas even they, possessed of great wisdom, are lying on a field, struck (with weapons) and deprived of life. The significance of the word Death hath today been made intelligible, for these lords of earth, of terrible prowess, have almost all been dead. Those heroes are lying motionless; reft of vanity, having succumbed to foes. Many princes, filled with wrath, have been victimised before the fire (of their enemies\\' wrath). A great doubt possesses me, viz., whence is Death? Whose (offspring) is Death? What is Death? Why does Death take away creatures? O grandsire, O thou that resemblest a god, tell me this.\\' \"Sanjaya continued, \\'Unto Kunti\\'s son, Yudhishthira, asking him thus, the illustrious Rishi, comforting him, said these words.\\' \"Vyasa said, As regards the matter in hand, O king, this ancient story of what Narada had in days of old said unto Akampana is cited. King Akampana, O monarch, I know, while in this world was afflicted with very great and unbearable grief on account of the death of his son, I will now tell these the excellent story about the origin of Death. Having listened to it, thou wilt be emancipated from sorrow and the touch of affection\\'s tie. Listen to me, O sire, as I recite this ancient history. This history is, indeed, excellent. It enhanceth the period of life, killeth grief and conduceth to health. It is sacred, destructive of large bodies of foes, and auspicious of all auspicious things. Indeed, this history is even as the study of the Vedas. O monarch, it should every morning be listened to by the foremost of kings who are desirous of longlived children and their own good. \"In days of old, O sire, there was a king named Akampana. Once, on the field of battle, he was surrounded by his foes and nearly overpowered by them. He had a son who was called Hari. Equal to Narayana himself in might, that latter was exceedingly handsome, accomplished in weapons, gifted with great intelligence, possessed of might, resembled Sakra himself in battle. Encompassed by countless foes on the field of battle, he sped thousands of shafts at those warriors and the elephants that surrounded him. Having achieved the most difficult feats in battle, O Yudhishthira, that scorcher of foes was, at last, slain in the midst of the army. Performing the obsequies of his son, king Akampana cleansed himself .[83] Grieving, however, for his son day and night, the king failed to regain happiness of mind. Informed of his grief on account of the death of his son, the celestial Rishi Narada came to his presence. The blessed king, beholding the celestial Rishi, told the latter everything that had happened unto him, viz., his defeat at the hands of his foes, and the slaughter of his son. And the king said, \\'My son was endued with great energy, and equalled Indra or Vishnu himself in splendour.

A development of Pradhana when it  has become Mahat is Egoism. From egoism is produced the development called the great elements. And of the great elements respectively, the  objects of sense are said to be the developments. The unmanifest  is of the nature of seed. It is productive in its essence. It has been heard by  us that the great soul has the virtues of a seed, and  that is a product.  Egoism is of the nature of seed and is a product again and again. And the  five great elements are of the nature of seed and products. The objects  of the five great elements are endued with the nature of seed, and yield  products. These have Chitta for their property. Among them, space has one  quality; wind is said to have two. Light, it is said, is endued with  three qualities; and water as possessed of four qualities. Earth, teeming  with mobiles and immobiles, should be known as possessed  of five  qualities. She is a goddess that is the source of all entities and  abounds with examples of the agreeable and the disagreeable. Sound,  likewise touch, colour, taste, and smell numbering the fifth, --these are  the five qualities of earth, ye  foremost of regenerate persons. Smell  always belongs to earth, and smell is said to be of various kinds. I shall state at length  the numerous qualities of smell. Smell is agreeable  or disagreeable, sweet, sour, pungent, diffusive and compact, oily and  dry, and clear. Thus smell, which belongs to the earth, should be known  as of ten kinds. Sound, touch, likewise colour, and  taste have been  said to be the qualities of water. I shall now speak of the qualities of  Taste. Taste has been said to be  of various kinds. Sweet, sour, pungent,  bitter, astringent, and saline likewise. Taste, which has been said to  appertain to water, is thus of  six varieties. Sound, touch, and likewise  colour, --these are the three qualities which light is said to be  posses sed of. Colour is  the quality of light, and colour is said to be of  various kinds. White, dark, likewise red, blue, yellow, and grey also,  and short, long, minute, gross, square and circular, of these twelve  varieties in colour which belongs to light. Thes e should be understood  by Brahmanas venerable for years, conversant with duties, and truthful in  speech. Sound and touch should be known as the two  qualities of wind.  Touch has been said to be of various kinds. Rough, cold and like wise  hot, tender and cle ar, hard, oily,  smooth, slippery, painful and soft, of  twelve kinds is touch, which is the quality of wind, as said by Brahmanas  crowned with  success, conversant with duties, and possessed of a sight of  truth. Now space has only one quality, and that is sa id to be sound.  I shall speak at length of the numerous qualities of sound. Shadaja,  Rishabha, together with Gandhara, Madhyama, and  likewise Panchama; after  this should be known Nishada, and then Dhaivata. Besides these,  there are agreeable sounds an d disagreeable sounds, compact, and of many  ingredients. Sound which is born of space should thus be known to be of  ten kinds. Space is the highest of the (five) elements. Egoism is above  it. Above egoism is understanding. Above understanding is the  soul. Above  the soul is the Unmanifest. Above the Unmanifest is Purusha. One who  knows which is superior and inferior  among existent creatures, who is  conversant with the ordinances in respect of all acts, and who  constitutes himself the soul of  all creatures, a ttains to the Unfading  Soul.\\'\" SECTION LI \"Brahmana said, \\'Since the mind is the ruler of these five elements, in  the matter of controlling and bringing them forth, the  mind, therefore,  is the soul of the elements. The mind always presides over the gre at elements. The understanding proclaims  power, and is called the  Kshetrajna. The mind yokes the senses as a charioteer yokes good  steeds. The senses, the mind,  and the understanding are always joined to  the Kshetrajna. The individual soul, mounting t he chariot to which big  steeds are  yoked and which has the understanding for the reins, drives  about on all sides. With all the senses attached to it (for steeds),  with the mind for the charioteer, and the understanding for the eternal reins,  exists the gr eat Brahman -car. Verily, that man endued with learning and  wisdom who always understands the Brahman -car in this way, is never  overwhelmed by delusion in  the midst of all entities. This forest of  Brahman begins with the Unmanifest and ends with gross objec ts. It includes mobile and immobile entities, and receives light from the  radiance of the sun and the moon, and is adorned with planets and  constellations. It is decked, again, on all sides with nets of rivers and  mountains. It is always embellished likewi se by diverse kinds of waters.  It is the means of subsistence for all creatures. It is, again, the goal  of all living creatures. In that forest the Kshetrajna always moves  about. Whatever entities exist in this world, mobile and immobile, are  the very firs t to be dissolved away. After this (are  dissolved) those  qualities which compose all entities. After the qualities (are dissolved)  the five elements. Such is the gradation  of entities. Gods, men,  Gandharvas, Pisachas, Asuras, and Rakshasas, have all sprung  from Nature,  and not from actions, not  from a cause. The Brahmanas, who are creators  of the universe, are born here again and again. All that springs from  them  dissolves, when the time comes, in those very five great elements  like billows in the ocean. Al l the great elements are beyond  those  elements that compose the universe. He that is released from those five  elements goes to the highest goal. The puissant  Prajapati created all  this by the mind only. After the same manner Rishis attained to the  status of deities by the aid of penance.  After the same manner, those who  have achieved perfection, who were capable of the concentration of Yoga,  and who subsist  on fruits and roots, likewise perceive the triple world  by penance. Medicines and herbs and all the d iverse sciences are acquired  by means of penance alone, for all acquisition has penance for its root.  Whatever is difficult of acquisition, difficult to learn,  difficult to  vanquish, difficult to pass through, are all achievable by penance, for  penance is irresistible. One that drinks  alcoholic liquors, one that  slays a Brahmana, one that steals, one that destroys a foetus, one that  violates one\\'s preceptor\\'s bed,  becomes cleansed of such sin by penance  well performed. Human beings, Pitris, deities, (sacrif icial) animals,  beasts and birds,  and all other creatures mobile and immobile, by always  devoting themselves to penances, become crowned with success by  penance  alone. In like manner, the deities, endued with great powers of illusion,  have attained to Heav en. Those who without  idleness perform acts with  expectations, being full of egoism, approach the presence of Prajapati.  Those high -souled ones,  however, who are devoid of mineness and freed  from egoism through the pure contemplation of Yoga,  attain to the  great  and  highest regions. Those who best understand the self, having attained  to Yoga contemplation and having their minds always  cheerful, enter into  the unmanifest accumulation of happiness. Those persons who are freed  from the idea of mineness as also  from egoism and who are reborn after  having attained to the fullness of Yoga contemplation, enter (when they  depart from',\n",

Those persons that are devoted to the religion of Truth, that are righteous and destitute of the indications of the several modes of life, and that enjoy the wealth earned by righteous means, succeed in ascending to heaven. Those men that are freed from all doubts, that are possessed of omniscience, and that have eyes to behold all things, are never enchained by either virtue or sin. Those men that are freed from all attachments can never be bound by the chains of action. They who never injure others in thought, word, or deed, and who never attach themselves to anything, can never be bound by acts.

Bhishma said, 'Thou knowest all duties. This question that thou askest is only for confirmation of thy conclusions. Listen now to Emancipation, and Renunciation, and Sin, and Virtue to their very roots. Perceiving any one of the five objects (viz., form, taste, scent, sound, and touch), desire runs after it at first. Indeed, obtaining them within the purview of the senses, O chief of Bharata's race, desire or aversion springs up. One, then, for the sake of that object (i.e., for acquisition of what is liked and avoidance of what is disliked) strives and begins acts that involve much labour. One endeavours one's best for repeatedly enjoying those forms and scents (and the three other objects of the remaining three senses) that appear very agreeable. Gradually, attachment, and aversion, and greed, and errors of judgment arise. The mind of one overwhelmed by greed and error and affected by attachment and aversion is never directed to virtue. One then begins with hypocrisy to do acts that are good. Indeed, with hypocrisy one then seeks to acquire virtue, and with hypocrisy one likes to acquire wealth. When one succeeds, O son of Kuru's race, in winning wealth with hypocrisy, one sets one's heart to such acquisition wholly. It is then that one begins to do acts that are sinful, notwithstanding the admonitions of well-wishers and the wise, unto all which he makes answers plausibly consistent with reason and conformable to the injunctions of the scriptures. Born of attachment and error, his sins, of three kinds, rapidly increase, for he thinks sinfully, speaks sinfully, and acts sinfully. When he fairly starts on the way of sin, they that are good mark his wickedness. They, however, that are of a disposition similar to that of the sinful man, enter into friendship with him. He succeeds not in winning happiness even here. Whence then would he succeed in winning happiness hereafter? It is thus that one becomes sinful. Listen now to me as I speak to thee of one that is righteous. Such a man, inasmuch as he seeks the good of others, succeeds in winning good for himself. By practising duties that are fraught with other people's good, he attains at last to a highly agreeable end. He who, aided by his wisdom, succeeds beforehand in beholding the faults above adverted to, who is skilled in judging of what is happiness and what is sorrow and how each is brought about, and who waits with reverence upon those that are good, makes progress in achieving virtue, both in consequence of his habit and such companionship of the good. The mind of such a person takes delight in virtue, and he lives on, making virtue his support. If he sets his heart on the acquisition of wealth, he desires only such wealth as may be acquired in righteous ways. Indeed, he waters the roots of only those things in which he sees merit. In this way, doth one become righteous and acquires friends that are good. In consequence of his acquisition of friends, of wealth, and of children, he sports in happiness both here and hereafter. The mastery (in respect of enjoyment) that a living creature attains over sound, touch, taste, form, and scent, O Bharata, represents the fruit of virtue. Remember this. Having obtained the fruit of virtue, O Yudhishthira, such a man does not give himself up to joy. Without being contented with such (visible) fruits of virtue he betakes himself to Renunciation, led on by the eye of knowledge. When, having acquired the eye of knowledge, he ceases to take pleasure in the gratification of desire, in taste and in scent, when he does not allow his mind to run towards sound, touch and form, it is then that he succeeds in freeing himself from desire. He does not, however, even then cast off virtue or righteous acts. Beholding then all the worlds to be liable to destruction, he strives to cast off virtue (with its rewards in the form of heaven and its happiness) and endeavours to attain to Emancipation by the (well-known) means. Gradually abandoning all sinful acts he betakes himself to Renunciation, and becoming righteous-souled succeeds at last in attaining to Emancipation. I have now told thee, O son, of that about which thou hadst asked me, viz., the topics of Sin, Righteousness, Renunciation, and Emancipation, O Bharata! Thou shouldst, therefore, O Yudhishthira, adhere to virtue in all situations. Eternal is the success, O son of Kunti, of thee that adherest to righteousness.' SECTION CCLXXIV Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast said, O grandsire, the Emancipation is to be won by means and not otherwise. I desire to hear duly what those means are.' Bhishma said, 'O thou of great wisdom, this enquiry that thou hast addressed to me and that is connected with a subtle topic, is really worthy of thee, since thou, O sinless one, always seekest to accomplish all thy objects by the application of means. That state of mind which is present when one sets oneself to make an earthen jar for one's use, disappears after the jar has been completed. After the same manner, that cause which urges persons who regard virtue as the root of advancement and prosperity ceases to operate with them that seek to achieve Emancipation. That path which leads to the Eastern Ocean is not the path by which one can go to the Western Ocean. There is only one path that leads to Emancipation. (It is not identical with any of those that lead to any other object of acquisition). Listen to me as I discourse on it to thee in detail. One should, by practising forgiveness, exterminate wrath, and by abandoning --all purposes, root out desire. By practising the quality of Sattwa one should conquer sleep. By heedfulness one should keep off fear, and by contemplation of the Soul one should conquer breath. Desire, aversion, and lust, one should dispel by patience; error, ignorance, and doubt, by study of truth. By pursuit after knowledge one should avoid insouciance and inquiry after things of no interest. By frugal and easily digestible fare one should drive off all disorders and diseases. By contentment one should dispel greed and stupefaction of judgment, and all worldly concerns should be avoided by a knowledge of the truth. By practising benevolence one should conquer iniquity, and by regard for all creatures one should acquire virtue. One should avoid expectation by the reflection that it is concerned with the future; and one should cast off wealth by abandoning desire itself. The man of intelligence should abandon affection by recollecting that everything (here) is transitory. He should subdue hunger by practising Yoga. By practising benevolence one should keep off all ideas of self-importance, and drive off all sorts of craving by adopting contentment. By exertion one should subdue procrastination, and by certainty all kinds of doubt, by taciturnity,'\",\n",

       " {'text': \"Lomasa said, 'Hear with attention, O king! how the name of Mandhata  belonging to that monarch of mighty soul hath come to be celebrated  throughout all the worlds. Yuvanaswa, the ruler of the earth, was sprung  from Ikshvaku's race. That protector of  the earth performed many  sacrificial rites noted for magnificent gifts. And the most excellent of all virtuous men performed a  thousand times the ceremony of sacrificing a  horse. And he also performed other sacrifices of the highest order,  wherein he  made abundant gifts. But that saintly king had no son. And he  of mighty soul and rigid vows made over to his ministers the  duties of  the state, and became a constant resident of the woods. And he of  cultured soul devoted himself to the pursuits  enjoined in the sacred  writ. And once upon a time, that protector of men, O king! had observed a  fast. And he was suffering  from the pangs of hunger and his inner soul  seemed parched with thirst. And (in this state) he entered the hermitage  of Bhrigu. On that very night, O king of kings! the great saint who was  the delight of Bhrigu's race, had officiated in a religious ceremony,  with the object that a son might be born to Saudyumni. O king of kings!  at the spot stood a large jar filled with water,  consecrated with the  recitation of sacred hymns, and which had been previously deposited  there. And the water was endued  with the virtue that the wife of  Saudyumni would by drinking the same, bring forth a god-like son. Those  mighty saints had deposited the jar on the altar and had gone to sleep,  having been fatigued by keeping up the night. And as Saudyumni passed  them by , his palate was dry, and he was suffering greatly from thirst.  And the king was very much in need of water to drink.  And he entered that  hermitage and asked for drink. And becoming fatigued, he cried in feeble  voice, proceeding from a parched  throat, which resembled the weak  inarticulate utterance of a bird. And his voice reached nobody's ears.  Then the king beheld  the jar filled with water. And he quickly ran  towards it, and having drunk the water, put the jar down. And as the  water was  cool, and as the  king had been suffering greatly from thirst,  the draught of water relieved the sagacious monarch and appeased  his thirst. Then those saints together with him of ascetic wealth, awoke from  sleep; and all of them observed that the water of the jar had gone.  Thereupon they met together and began to enquire as to who might have  done it. Then Yuvanaswa truthfully  admitted that it was his act. Then the  revered son of Bhrigu spoke unto him, saying. 'It was not proper. This  water had an occult  virtue infused into it, and had been placed there  with the object that a son might be born to thee. Having performed severe  austerities, I infused the virtue of my religious acts in this water,  that a son might be born to thee. O saintly king of mighty  valour and physical strength! a son would have been born to thee of exceeding  strength and valour, and strengthened by  austerities, and who would have  sent by his bravery even Indra to the abode of the god of death. It was  in this manner, O king!  that this water had been prepared by me. By  drinking this water, O king, thou hast done what was not at all right.  But it is  impossible now for us to turn back the accident which hath  happened. Surely what thou hast done must have been the fiat of  Fate.  Since thou, O great king, being a  thirst hast drunk water prepared with  sacred hymns, and filled with the virtue of my religious labours, thou  must bring forth out of thy own body a son of the character described  above. To that end we shall  perform a sacrifice for thee, of wonderful  effect s o that, valorous as thou art, thou wilt bring forth a son equal  to Indra. Nor  will thou experience any trouble on account of the labour  pains.' Then when one hundred years had passed away, a son shining  as the  sun pierced the left side of the king endowed with a mighty soul, and  came forth. And the son was possessed of mighty  strength. Nor did  Yuvanaswa die --which itself was strange. Then Indra of mighty strength  came to pay him a visit. And the  deities enquired of the great Indra,  'What is to be sucked by this boy?' Then Indra introduced his own  forefinger into his mouth.  And when the wielder of the thunderbolt said,  'He will suck me,' the dwellers of heaven together with Indra christened  the boy  Mandhata, (literally, Me he shall suck). Then the boy having  tasted the forefinger extended by Indra, became possessed of  mighty  strength, and he grew thirteen cubits, O king. And O great king! the  whole of sacred learning together with the holy  science of arms, was  acquired by that masterful boy, who gained all tha t knowledge by the  simple and unassisted power of his  thought. And all at once, the bow  celebrated under the name of Ajagava and a number of shafts made of horn,  together with an  impenetrable coat of mail, came to his possession on the  very same day, O son of Bharata's race! And he was placed on the  throne  by Indra himself and he conquered the three worlds in a righteous way, as  Vishnu did by his three strides. And the  wheel of the car of that mighty  king was irresistible in its course  (throughout the world). And the gems,  of their own accord,  came into the possession of that saintly king. This  is the tract of land, O lord of earth, which belonged to him. It abounds  in  wealth. He performed a number of sacrificial rites of various kinds,  in which abundant gratuities were paid to the priests. O  king! he of  mighty force and unmeasured lustre, erected sacred piles, and performed  splendid pious deeds, and attained the  position of sitting at Indra's  side. That sagacious king of unswerving piety sent forth his fiat, and  simply by its virtue conquered  the earth, together with the sea --that source of gems --and all the cities of the  earth, O great  king! The sacrificial  grounds prepared by him were to be found all over  the earth on all sides round --not a single spot, but was marked with the  same. O great king! the mighty monarch is said to have given to the  Brahmanas ten thousand padmas of kine. When there was  a drought, which  continued for twelve consecutive years, the mighty king caused rain to  come down f or the growth of crops,  paying no heed to Indra, the wielder  of the thunder-bolt, who remained staring (at him). The mighty ruler of  the Gandhara land,  born in the lunar dynasty of kings, who was terrible  like a roaring cloud, was slain by him, who wound ed him sorely with his  shafts. O king! he of cultured soul protected the four orders of people,  and by him of mighty force the worlds were kept from  harm, by virtue of  his austere and righteous life. This is the spot where he, lustrous like  the sun, sacrificed to the god. Look at it! here it is, in the midst of  the field of the Kurus, situated in a tract, the holiest of all. O  preceptor of earth! requested by thee, I  have thus narrated to thee the  great life of Mandhata, and also the way in which he was bor n, which was  a birth of an extraordinary kind.'\",\n",

They who know the Soul have no fear of returning to the world.\\'\\'\\n\\nSECTION CCCVIII\\n\\n\"\\'Vasishtha said, I have thus far discoursed to thee on the Sankhya philosophy. Listen now to me as I tell thee what is Vidya (knowledge) and what is Avidya (Ignorance), one after the other. The learned say that that Prakriti, which is fraught with the attributes of Creation and Destruction, is called Avidya; while Purusha, who is freed from the attributes of Creation and Destruction and who transcends the four and twenty topics or principles, is called Vidya. Listen to me first as I tell thee what is Vidya among successive sets of other things, as expounded in the Sankhya philosophy. Among the senses of knowledge and those of action, the senses of knowledge are said to constitute what is known as Vidya. Of the senses of knowledge and their object, the former constitute Vidya as has been heard by us. Of objects of the senses and the mind, the wise have said that the mind constitute Vidya. Of mind and the five subtile essences, the five subtile essences constitutes Vidya. Of the five subtile essences and Consciousness, Consciousness constitutes Vidya. Of Consciousness and Mahat, Mahat, O king, is Vidya. Of all the topics or principles beginning with Mahat, and Prakriti, it is Prakriti, which is unmanifest and supreme, that is called Vidya. Of Prakriti, and that called Vidhi which is Supreme, the latter should be known as Vidya. Transcending Prakriti is the twenty-fifth (called Purusha) who should be known as Vidya. Of all knowledge that which is the Object of Knowledge has been said to be the Unmanifest, O king.[1 627] Again, Knowledge has been said to be Unmanifest and the Object of knowledge to be that which transcends the four and twenty. Once more, Knowledge has been said to be Unmanifest, and the Knower is that which transcends the four and twenty. I have now told thee what is truly the import of Vidya and Avidya. Listen now to me as I tell thee all that has been said about the Indestructible, and the Destructible. Both Jiva and Prakriti have been said to be Indestructible, and both of them have been said to be Destructible. I shall tell thee the reason of this correctly as I have understood it. Both Prakriti and Jiva are without beginning and without end or destruction. Both of them are regarded as supreme (in the matter of Creation). Those that are possessed of knowledge say that both are to be called topics or principles. In consequence of its attributes of (repeated) Creation and Destruction, the Unmanifest (or Prakriti) is called Indestructible. That Unmanifest becomes repeatedly modified for the purpose of creating the principle. And because the principles beginning with Mahat are produced by Purusha as well, and because also Purusha and the Unmanifest are mutually dependant upon each other, therefore is Purusha also, the twenty-fifth, called Kshetra (and hence Akshara or Indestructible).[1628] When the Yogin withdraws and merges all the principles into the Unmanifest Soul (or Brahma) then the twenty-fifth (viz., Jiva or Purusha) also, with all those principles disappears into it. When the principles become merged each into its progenitor, then the one that remains is Prakriti. When Kshetrajna too,[1629] O son, becomes merged into his own producing cause then (all that remains is Brahma and, therefore) Prakriti with all the principles in it becomes Kshara (or meets with destruction), and attains also to the condition of being without attributes in consequence of her dissociation from all the principles. Thus it is that Kshetrajna, when his knowledge of Kshetra disappears, becomes, by his nature, destitute of attributes, as it has been heard by us. When he becomes Kshara he then assumes attributes. When, however, he attains to his own real nature, he then succeeds in understanding his own condition of being really destitute of attributes. By casting off Prakriti and beginning to realize that he is different from her, the intelligent Kshetrajna then comes to be regarded as pure and stainless. When Jiva ceases to exist in a state of union with Prakriti, then does he become identifiable with Brahma. When, however, he exists united with Prakriti, he then, O king, seems to be different from Brahma. Indeed, when Jiva shows no affection for Prakriti and her principles, he then succeeds in beholding the Supreme and having once beheld Him wishes not to fall away from that felicity. When the knowledge of truth dawns upon him, Jiva begins to lament in this strain: Alas, how foolishly have I acted by falling through ignorance, into this frame composed of Prakriti like a fish entangled in a net! Alas, through ignorance, I have migrated from body to body like a fish from water to water thinking that water is the element in which alone it can live. Indeed, like a fish that does not know anything else than water to be its element, I also have never known anything else than children and spouses to be my own! Fie on me that through ignorance, I have been repeatedly migrating from body to body in forgetfulness (of the Supreme Soul)! The Supreme Soul alone is my friend. I have capacity for friendship with Him. Whatever be my nature and whoever I may be, I am competent to be like Him and to attain an identity with Him. I see my similarity with Him. I am indeed, like Him. He is stainless. It is evident that I am of the same nature. Through ignorance and stupefaction, I have become associated with inanimate Prakriti. Though really without attachments, I have passed this long time in a state of attachment with Prakriti. Alas, by her was I so long subdued without having been able to know it. Various are the forms --high, middling, and low, that Prakriti assume. Oh, how shall I dwell in those forms? How shall I live conjointly with her? In consequence only of my ignorance I repair to her companionship. I shall now be fixed (in Sankhya or Yoga). I shall not longer keep her companionship. For having passed so long a time with her, I should think that I was so long deceived by her, for myself being really exempt from modification, how could I keep company with one that is subject to modification? She cannot be held to be responsible for this. The responsibility is mine, since turning away from the Supreme Soul I become of my own accord attached to her. In consequence of that attachment, myself, though formless in reality, had to abide in multifarious forms. Indeed, though formless by nature I become endued with forms in consequence of my sense of meum, and thereby insulted and distressed. In consequence of my sense of meum, concerning the result of Prakriti, I am forced to take birth in diverse orders of Being. Alas, though really destitute of any sense of meum, yet in consequence of affecting it, what diverse acts of an evil nature have been committed by me in those orders which I took birth while I remained in them with a soul that',\n",

These all I know, but thou dost not, O chastiser of foes.  Though (I am) unborn and of essence that knoweth no deterioration, though  (I am) the lord of all creatures, still, relying on my own (material)  nature I take birth by my own (powers) of illusion. Whenever, O Bharata,  loss of piety and the rise of impiety occurreth, on those occasions do I create myself. For the protection of the righteous and for the  destruction of the evil doers, for the sake of establishing Piety, I am  born age after age. He who truly knoweth my divine birth and work to  be such, casting off (his body) is not born again; (on the other hand) he  cometh to me, O Arjuna. Many who have been freed from attachment, fear,  wrath, who were full of me, and who relied on me, have, cleansed by  knowledge and asceticism, attained to my essence. In whatsoever manner  men come to me, in  the selfsame manner do I accept them. It is my way, O  Partha, that men follow on all sides. Those in this world who are  desirous of the success of action worship the gods, for in this world of  men success resulting from action is soon attained. The quadruple  division of castes was created by me according to the distinction of  qualities and duties. Though I am the author thereof, (yet) know me to be  not their author and undecaying. Actions do not touch me. I have no  longing for the fruits of actions. He that knoweth me thus is not impeded  by actions. Knowing this, even men of old who were desirous of  emancipation performed work. Therefore, do thou also perform work as was  done by ancients of the remote past. What is action and what is  inaction, --even the learned are perplexed at this. Therefore, I will tell  thee about action (so that) knowing it thou mayst be freed from evil. One  should have knowledge of action, and one should have knowledge of  forbidden actions: one should also know of inaction. The course of action  is incomprehensible. He, who sees inaction in action and action in  inaction, is wise among men; he is possessed of devotion; and he is a  doer of all actions. The learned call him wise whose efforts are all free  from desire (of fruit) and  (consequent) will, and whose actions have all  been consumed by the fire of knowledge. Whoever, resigning all  attachment to the fruit of action, is ever contented and is dependent on  none, doth nought, indeed, although engaged in action. He who, with  out desire, with mind and the senses under control, and casting off all  concerns, performeth action only for the preservation of the body,  incurreth no sin. He who is contented with what is earned without  exertion, who hath risen superior to the pairs of  opposites, who is  without jealousy, who is equable in success and failure, is not fettered  (by action) even though he works. All his actions perish who acts for the  sake of sacrifice, who is without affections, who is free (from  attachments), and whose mind is fixed upon knowledge. Brahma is the  vessel (with which the libation is poured); Brahma is the libation (that  is  offered); Brahma is the fire on which by Brahma is poured (the  libation); Brahma is the goal to which he proceedeth by fixing  his mind on Brahma itself which is the action. Some devotees perform  sacrifice to the gods. Others, by means of sacrifice, offer up sacrifices  to the fire of Brahma. Others offer up (as sacrificial libation) the  senses of which hearing is the first to  the fire of restraint. Others  (again) offer up (as libations) the objects of sense of which sound is  the first to the fire of the senses. Others (again) offer up all the  functions of the senses and the functions of the vital winds to the fire  of devotion by self-restraint kindled by knowledge. Others again  perform the sacrifice of wealth, the sacrifice of ascetic austerities,  the  sacrifice of meditation, the sacrifice of (Vedic) study, the  sacrifice of knowledge, and others are ascetics of rigid vows. Some  offer up the upward vital wind (Prana) to the downward vital wind  (apana); and others, the downward vital wind to the  upward vital wind;  some, arresting the course of (both) the upward and the downward vital  winds, are devoted to the restraint  of the vital winds. Others of  restricted rations, offer the vital winds to the vital winds. Even  all these who are conversant with sacrifice, whose sins have been  consumed by sacrifice, and who eat the remnants of sacrifice which are  amrita, attain to the eternal Brahma. (Even) this world is not for him  who doth not perform sacrifice. Whence then the other, O best of Kuru\\'s  race? Thus diverse are the sacrifices occurring in the Vedas. Know that  all of them result from action, and knowing this thou  wilt be  emancipated. The sacrifice of knowledge, O chastiser of foes, is superior  to every sacrifice involving (the attainment of) fruits of action, for  all action, O Partha, is wholly comprehended in knowledge. Learn  that (Knowledge) by prostration, enquiry, and service. They who are  possessed of knowledge and can see the truth, will teach thee that  knowledge, knowing  which, O son of Pandu, thou wilt not again come by  such delusion, and by which thou wilt see the endless creatures (of the  universe) in  thyself (first) and then in me. Even if thou be the greatest  sinner among all that are sinful, thou shalt yet cross over  all transgressions by the raft of knowledge. As a blazing fire, O Arjuna,  reduceth fuel to ashes, so doth the fire of knowledge  reduce  all actions  to ashes. For there is nothing here that is so cleansing as knowledge.  One who hath attained to success by devotion finds it without effort  within his own self in time. He obtaineth knowledge, who hath faith and  is intent on it and who hath his senses under control; obtaining  knowledge one findeth the highest tranquillity in no length of time. One  who hath no knowledge and no faith, and whose minds is full of doubt, is  lost. Neither this world, nor the next, nor happiness, is for him  whose  mind  is full of doubt.

Though our own strength may be great, we should weigh it against the enemy\\'s strength and then decide whether we should seek war or avoid it. But first it is essential that we should restore Sita. My advice is this, before Rama and the Vanaras attack Lanka, let us restore Sita. Dear brother, I am saying all this for your good. Pray, do not be angry with me. We should first set right our own fault and then think of other things. Thus with folded hands Vibhishana besought Ravana. Though Ravana was pleased with the vainglorious words of his ministers and generals, there was doubt lurking in his mind. Hence, after listening to Vibhishana, he said: \"Let us meet again tomorrow and consider this matter.\" He adjourned the Council, and retired. 62. RAVANA CALLS A COUNCIL AGAIN AS soon as the day dawned, Vibhishana went to the king. He had thought deeply over the matter and had come to a decision. His brother\\'s welfare demanded that he should seek somehow to convert and save him. Vibhishana entered the royal palace and stood with folded hands before the king. Ravana sent away all but the principal Ministers and asked his brother to speak. \"My brother and my lord,\" began Vibhishana, \"forgive me if what I say is not pleasing to your ears. My desire is not to flatter but to save you from a great danger while there is yet time. I beg of you to listen to me, consider well what I say and then decide on your course of action. \"Ever since you brought Sita to Lanka we see only evil omens. Even when the libation is poured with the correct mantra, the flame does not spring to receive it. One finds snakes in places of worship. Ants infest food offerings. The udders of cows are dry and yield no milk. Elephants, horses, camels and monkeys fall sick, reject food and behave strangely. Medicines have lost their efficacy. Crows perch in numbers on the housetops making hideous noises. Vultures circling overhead fill the augurs with anxiety. Foxes boldly enter the city and howl at unusual hours. Wild beasts haunt the streets. These portents should not be disregarded. I beg of you, restore Sita to her husband. It is only since her coming here that these omens are noticed as you can verify by asking others. Why should we, who have so much to lose, needlessly incur any one\\'s enmity? Let us restore Sita to her people and live happily. Thus did Vibhishana plead earnestly with his brother. \"Never, never!\" exclaimed Ravana. \"Let there be no talk here of Sita being returned to her people. I do not think much of this enemy. I see nothing to be afraid of. Now, you may go. Though he spoke thus and was obstinate, Ravana had no peace of mind. Sita had not yielded to him and his own near kinsmen disapproved of his conduct. He was agitated, but putting on an air of confidence and unconcern he summoned the Council again. Lust and injured vanity kept him from the straight path, but he found some consolation in taking counsel from others.

I am here before you, none other than brother to Ravana, who killed Jatayu and carried off Sita by force and is now keeping her a prisoner in Lanka.

They are standing there in the sky. Consider well, you who are skilled in affairs, what should be done now. These Rakshasas are adepts in duplicity. They can make themselves invisible and do many other tricks. They have all the skill and courage of the wicked. One cannot trust them. I believe that these Rakshasas have been sent by Ravana himself. They have come here to mix with us for subversive purposes. Or else they intend seeking an opportunity to assassinate the leaders in our camp. Whatever Vibhishana may say, we cannot forget that he is the brother of our foe. By birth he belongs to the wicked Rakshasa race. How can we trust him? This is some trick of Ravana, I have no doubt. It is best to kill Vibhishana and his companions right now. If we admit him into our camp, he will betray us at the first opportunity and return to his own people. Permit us, therefore, to destroy forthwith Ravana\\'s brother and his followers.\" Having thus frankly expressed his feelings at the sight of the Rakshasa, Sugriva stood in silence, awaiting Rama\\'s reply. Rama listened and turned to Hanuman and other leaders and said: \"You have heard the words of the King who is well-versed in policy. Ravana\\'s brother has come and waits there for our pleasure. I wish to know your opinion on this matter. In times of crisis, one should ask for the advice of friends.

We do not know whether he has come of his own accord or was sent by our foe. While perhaps it would not be right to reject him out of hand, it would be dangerous to accept him without testing him. Let us at least watch his behavior carefully without giving him any opening for mischief. If his movements are suspicious, we can throw him out. If they are friendly and show good faith, we shall accept him.\" Thus spoke the son of Vali. Sarabha said: \"I do not think it safe to admit him now or to decide later what to do with him. Even now, let us test him through skilful questioners and decide once and for all what to do with him.\" Jambavan said: \"Nothing can be discovered by testing such persons.

Thus succinctly did Hanuman convey to the prince the glad news that Sita was found and was well in body and mind. Sugriva and Lakshmana, beside themselves with joy, embraced Rama. \"Dear Vanara friends,\" exclaimed the Prince of Ayodhya, \"tell me where exactly Sita is. How is she? How did you manage to see her? Tell me everything in detail.\" His eager inquiries came quick upon one another. The other Vanaras turned to Hanuman who stood behind, and asked him to narrate all that he had seen and done. Hanuman began to tell the tale. With his unrivalled courage and strength and single-handed, he had performed a mighty task. Yet he did not push himself forward into the presence of Prince Rama or King Sugriva, but gave precedence to Angada and the aged Jambavan and the others, and was silent until they asked him to speak. Indeed, generally, great men who dare and do mighty deeds are disinclined to speak about their exploits. In painting this scene the poet brings out this law of natural conduct. Another thing to note here is Hanuman\\'s reverence for Sita. From the time he first saw her, his reverence for Sita appeared to surpass even his devotion to Rama, if the two could be distinguished. This is the case with all pious devotees who regard and worship the Supreme as Mother. When that aspect of the All immanent Power is before true devotees, their reverence becomes ecstatic like the child\\'s joy in the mother\\'s lap. \"Crossing the hundred yojanas of water, I reached the city of the wicked Ravana on the southern shore. There, in a park attached to the palace, I saw Sita held prisoner and closely guarded. It was wonderful to see her emaciated form. She maintained life only in the thought of her lord and repetition of his name. Cruel and ugly Rakshasis surrounded her. I saw her',\n",

Do look at it. What color! What playfulness!\" And so she went on, talking of the deer and desiring to possess it. And she pleaded: \"Do somehow catch it for me.\" She begged Rama: \"Soon we shall have to return to the city. Should we not take some rare thing from the forest to Ayodhya? How beautiful it will be, this exquisite creature moving in the inner apartments of our palace? Bharata would be so pleased. I should love to give it to him. Do my beloved, catch it for me. Somehow catch it for me.\" Sita saw that Lakshmana did not seem to like her importunity. This only made her more determined to persuade Rama to get it for her. If a strong desire creeps into our heart and someone stands in the way of it, we are angry with him no matter how dear he may be to us. This unfortunate truth about the way that desire works in the human mind is explained clearly by the Lord in the Gita. It was demonstrated by what happened in Sita\\'s heart now. \"Look !\" she exclaimed, \"it is all gold! Look now! It is all silver! If you cannot capture the creature alive, at least bring it down with an arrow and let us take the skin home. We shall never again see such a beautiful skin. It would be a lovely thing to sit on. Look. It is going away. Do go and catch it alive. Or else, let me have at least the skin.\" Again she said, \"Look, look again. All these long years, I never saw such a beautiful thing in these forests. It is like a cluster of shining stars!\" Rama could no longer resist her entreaties. He said to himself: \"Even if Lakshmana be right and the creature is a Rakshasa so much the better reason for killing it. What is there to be afraid of? If I cannot catch it alive, I can bring it down with an arrow and give the skin to Sita. When she is so keen on having it, is it not my duty to get it for her?\" And he told Lakshmana to bring him his bow and arrows. Lakshmana\\'s heart was not in it, but he obeyed. And Rama set out saying: \"Mind, Lakshmana, remain by Sita\\'s side and guard her vigilantly. I shall come back soon with this stag alive or killed. Do not be anxious. Even if this is a Rakshasa, what does it matter? It will share the fate of Vatapi. If this has come here to cheat me, as Vatapi tried to cheat Agastya, why then, it will be the victim of its own deceit. What can this animal do to me? Stag or Rakshasa, it is all the same.\" Again he said, \"Be careful. Mind Sita. Anything might happen at any time. Be vigilant.\" Destiny had set the stage for misfortune. Strangely enough Lakshmana, who was by nature hasty and quick to act, was suspicious on this occasion and Rama, who was usually circumspect now yielded to Sita\\'s foolish wish, and disregarding Lakshmana\\'s warning, went in pursuit of the Maricha-stag. In order to give Ravana plenty of time and opportunity, Maricha kept within sight of Rama, but beyond his reach, and drew him on and on like fate. The deer would take a few steps, then stop and turn and stare at the pursuer. Then suddenly it would start as if in fear. Pricking its ears, it would spring drawing up its hooves to its breast. It would disappear for a while among the trees. Emerging soon on some tall mound, it would display its lovely outline framed against a passing cloud. Sometimes it allowed near approach',\n",

Then the Rakshasa realised this game would not go on forever and that his end was near. Rama, tired of the pursuit, bent his bow and sent forth an arrow. It pierced the stag. Maricha resumed his natural form and simulating Rama\\'s voice called out, \"Ah Sita, Ah Lakshmana!\" and fell dead. \"Lakshmana was right,\" said Rama to himself. \"This deer was indeed a Rakshasa.\" He thought further: \"Hearing his last cry, maybe, Sita will be deceived. She is likely to be overwhelmed by fear.\" He then said to himself again: \"What if Sita entertains false fears? Lakshmana is there by her side.\" His heart then swelled with pride and joy that he had a brother like Lakshmana, so loving and so steadfast. How could Rama guess what was happening at that very instant in the ashrama, and what painful words Lakshmana had to bear from Sita? Truly, the way of destiny is cruel. 36. THE GOOD BIRD JATA YU \"ALAS, alas! Ah Sita! Ah Lakshmana!\" So cried Maricha simulating Rama\\'s voice. And Sita was deceived. Trembling like a plantain tree in a storm, she cried: \"There, Lakshmana, do you not hear your brother\\'s voice? Run, run at once to his help!\" Overwhelmed by fear and seeing Lakshmana unwilling to move, she appealed to Lakshmana again and again in an agony of anxiety: \"I hear my Lord\\'s voice in distress. Go, go at once! Do not delay!\" she cried. \"He is in some great danger. Did you not hear his cry for help? Why do you still stand here? Your brother is no doubt surrounded by Rakshasas and cries for help. Instead of rushing to his rescue, you stand still here!\" Lakshmana knew the wiles of the Rakshasas and remembered his brother\\'s command. He would not move. Sita grew furious in her agony of fear and doubt. She beat her breast with both hands and shouted in uncontrollable fury: \"Son of Sumitra! Have you too turned foe? Have you been an imposter all these years? Have you been with us waiting only for Rama to die? Pretending to be his friend, were you hoping all the time for his death to secure me thereafter? Why else do you stand here, wicked wretch, and refuse to go to his rescue when he cries for help? Traitor! Imposter!\" These cruel words pierced Lakshmana\\'s heart like poisoned arrows. He closed his ears with his hands. He spoke gently to Sita, who was in tears of wrath: \"Vaidehi, Rama can encounter and vanquish any foe in the world. There is no need to fear, O more than mother! Calm yourself. None in the universe is strong enough to touch our Rama or do him harm. What you have uttered is unworthy of you, my mother. Do not fear or grieve. You will surely see Rama return with the body of the stag you wanted. The voice we heard was not his. It is a Rakshasa\\'s trick. Do not be deceived and grieve for nothing.

Mounted on chariots that shone like the hills on the evening horizon and on the back of great elephants and beautiful horses, Ravana's army went in full force for the great battle. The Vanaras tore up rocks and trees and attacked the Rakshasas fiercely. The Rakshasas returned the attack with equally grim ferocity. The Vanaras jumped about everywhere and worked havoc among the Rakshasas, their chariots and animals. Each of the Rakshasas was surrounded by many Vanaras and slain. The Rakshasas too did not spare the Vanaras whom they killed in tens of thousands. Rama bent his bow and sent showers of arrows against the Rakshasas who destroyed their army like a raging fire. Warriors only saw their companions fall. They could not see Rama because of the shower of arrows. Their fear conjured up a multitude of Ramas, who dealt death in all directions. Countless elephants and horses perished. Thousands of chariots were broken. The Rakshasa army was destroyed, all but a handful who fled into Lanka. The Devas, Gandharvas and Siddhas sang the praise of Rama from above. In Lanka, the Rakshasa women clung to each other and lamented loudly that Ravana's folly should have brought this great calamity on them. END OF RAVANA THERE was wailing in every house in Lanka. In Ravana's breast grief, shame and anger seethed like a raging sea. He had so far sent his commanders and men in detachments, and, brave as they were, they had been destroyed in detail. This had been the result of overweening confidence in his invincibility and contempt for the enemy, most of whom fought with no better weapons than sticks and stones. But repeated reverses had brought him no wisdom. He had not even disputed the passage of the sea but allowed the enemy a lodgment in his island. But negligent and reckless as a general, he was brave and finally resolving to fight himself and with his sole strength to destroy the foe, he set out. He had full faith in his prowess and in the efficacy of the boons he had secured and he went forth with confidence mounted on his divine chariot that was drawn by eight horses and filled with all manner of weapons accompanied by a division of Rakshasa chariot-warriors. As Ravana issued out of Lanka, the sun seemed obscured by an unpredicted eclipse, and foul birds and beasts of the night roared at large with weird ill-omened cries; but disregarding it all, Ravana drove out to battle accompanied by Virupaksha, Mahodara and Mahaparsva. The mighty Rakshasa warriors who followed Ravana were mowed down by a deadly flight of arrows and chunks of rocks and presently Ravana found himself facing Lakshmana, who tried to oppose his further progress. Forcing his way past Lakshmana, Ravana precipitated himself against Rama with all the pent-up fury of hatred and revenge and strove to overwhelm him with a spate of arrows. Rama easily baffled these arrows with his own and struck Ravana repeatedly, without however being able to penetrate his armor. Thus they fought, these supreme bowmen, each bent on slaying the other and using increasingly potent missiles of secret power, while the gods in heaven looked on with marvel and admiration.

Before going, he said to Rama: \"You will assuredly regain Sita. Go to the beautiful banks of the Pampa and seek the help of Sugriva living there on the Rishyamuka hill. Driven out of the kingdom by his brother Vali, he lives in constant fear and danger. Gain his friendship, and you will succeed in your attempt.\" Saying this Kabandha disappeared. Rama and Lakshmana now set forward in the direction of the Pampa. In that lovely region they visited the ashrama of the aged sanyasini, Sabari, the disciple of Rishi Matanga, and accepted her hospitality. Sabari was a woman of a forest tribe and a faithful serving sister in the ashrama of the old saint Matanga. When he departed this life, she wanted to die too. But he said the time was not yet and she should await the arrival of Rama, an incarnation of Vishnu, for the bliss of his darshan was in store for her. So the old and wrinkled woman lived her saintly life, looking faithfully after the ashrama as of old and keeping it sweet to receive the promised guest. When the princes came, she produced the fruits she had gathered and kept for them, and described and showed to them the wonders of the Matanga ashrama. Then with their leave, she kindled a fire and entering it ascended to heaven. The meeting with this saintly woman and the waters of the river Pampa gave strength of mind to the princes. They thought over what should be done next. Said Rama: \"Lakshmana, I am beginning to think that we shall succeed. Let us search the forest for Sugriva whose help we should obtain.\" They went all over the Pampa area. The place was lovely, but the loveliness of the spot and the animals, birds, trees and creepers only increased Rama\\'s grief. Every beautiful object wrung his heart and made him think: \"How much would Sita have enjoyed this?\" Try as he might, he could not control the human sorrow which by his incarnation he had undertaken to endure. Lakshmana tried to revive his spirit. He said: \"Even if Sita is kept hidden in the womb of Aditi, the mother of the gods, we will discover her. Ravana cannot escape. It is certain we shall kill him and redeem Sita. It is not proper that you should thus despair. How can you let anxiety or weakness come over you? If we lose a precious thing, we should work for its recovery with perseverance. Sometimes our very affection becomes our enemy. Too much love brings on grief and grief weakens effort. What need is there for me to tell you all this? You know it all. Let us not lose hope. Let us forget the grief brought on by love and bend our mind and body to exertion. Be brave. Be hopeful. We shall succeed. Get rid of your sorrow, brother!\" The younger brother thus advised Rama. Commentators look upon Lakshmana as Adisesha.

Indrajit, bright like the gods, accepted his father\\'s command with reverence and receiving his blessings went with courage and eagerness towards the Asoka Vana. Standing in a chariot drawn by four fierce lions and twanging his bowstring, Indrajit proceeded towards Hanuman. His chariot sounded like the wind off the monsoon. His lotus-like eyes shone victory. As Hanuman saw the chariot coming towards him, he was filled with joy. Indrajit too, skilful in battle, bent his bow and got his sharp arrows ready for Hanuman. Knowing that a great battle was at hand, the Nagas, Yakshas and Siddhas assembled in the sky to see. At the sight of Indrajit Hanuman roared and increased his stature still further. Silently the Rakshasa warrior dispatched his darts. Showers of arrows began to descend as in the battle of the gods and their cousins, the Asuras. Hanuman rose in the sky and, moving with speed like lightning, struck down the sharp arrows. His roar made the quarters echo, drowning the drumbeats and the bow-twangs of the Rakshasa. The battle raged with increasing fury and filled all beholders with amazement. In skill and strength the two warriors were perfect equals. No matter how often he was wounded, Hanuman\\'s strength showed no signs of lessening. Indrajit therefore resolved: \"My arrows cannot vanquish this monkey. What my father said is true. He can be bound only by using the Brahmastra.\" The Rakshasa Prince sent forth the Brahmastra. At its touch the Vanara warrior lay bound and helpless. Hanuman realised what had happened. He said to himself: \"I have been bound by the Brahmastra.\" Hanuman too had secured a boon from Brahma, and this he now remembered. \"This will keep me bound for only one muhoorta (four fifths of an hour),\" he said to himself. \"I run no real risk. Let me see what the Rakshasas do to me while I lie bound and helpless. I might find here a further opportunity to function as a messenger.\" As instructed by Brahma when he gave him the gift of immortality, he surrendered himself to the Brahmastra and lay down on the ground, inactive but in full possession of his faculties. When they saw Hanuman thus lying helpless on the ground the Rakshasas who till then stood at a distance in fear, surrounded him and danced with joy and called him insulting names and praised their prince. \"We shall cut you to pieces!\" they shouted. \"Let us eat him up. We shall drag him to the throne of our Ravana.\" Thus and in many other ways they shouted. A few among them feared and said: \"This fellow is only pretending.

A huge monkey terrible to look at has laid waste the royal garden. It was in secret talk with Sita. Of course they omitted to add that they had fallen asleep and given a chance for Sita to talk to the monkey. We tried our best to get some information from Sita, they added. We asked her who he was, and how he came there, and what he told her. But she refuses to answer. You should seize and slay this creature. Do send a strong foe. The beautiful grove is completely devastated except for the Simsupa tree under which Sita is seated. Its spreading branches have suffered no damage. The monkey which laid waste the tanks and bowers has spared the habitation of Sita. There must be a reason for this. We suspect that this is not an ordinary wild animal. It must have been sent by some enemy of yours, either Indra or Kubera. Or could it have anything to do with Rama? How did this monkey dare to talk to Sita? He must be a messenger from Rama. Do send your warriors to capture this terrible beast. Ravana was furious on hearing that his favorite park, set apart for his queens, had been destroyed. His eyes glowed like twin torches and hot tears rolled down from them like drops of burning oil. He turned to the bodyguards standing beside him ever eager to do his bidding and ordered them at once to go and destroy the monster-monkey. A strong force started to execute the king's commands, armed with maces and spears and other weapons. THE TERRIBLE ENVOY THE Rakshasa warriors saw with amazement a mighty Vanara seated on the garden gate, who at their approach grew to still bigger size and formidable menace. Oh! You have come, have you? he said and, jumping down, brandished his tail, and striking the ground with it, roared till the four quarters shook. He snatched the huge iron bar from the gate and, armed with this weapon, began to attack them all. He sprang and leaped in all directions and, whirling the iron rod, struck the Rakshasas down, one by one. After finishing them thus, he resumed his seat on the top of the pillared entrance, and roared once again. Long live Rama! Long live Lakshmana! he loudly proclaimed. Long live King Sugriva! Oh!

What is it you say? he yelled, and called Jambumali, the matchless warrior, son of Prahasta. And be said to him. Go at once! Punish this monkey and report to me.

Her physical courage failed and nature had its way. She sobbed like a child. But even in her sobs her mind was clear and it was fixed on Rama. \"In Janasthana Rama destroyed thousands of Rakshasas. Why does not Rama come yet to redeem me? The warrior princes who killed Viradha in Dandaka, why are they still indifferent to my fate? It could only be that they do not yet know where I am! Jatayu, the vulture king, was slain by the Rakshasa. If he at least were alive, he would have told them the news that he saw the Rakshasa carrying me. But he gave up his life in trying to save me. But how long, will Rama remain ignorant of my being here? How long can Lanka and the Rakshasas survive? It is certain that, in every house in this city, Rakshasa widows will soon be lamenting loudly. It is certain that this city of Ravana and the whole Rakshasa race will perish. Thus she thought within herself and slowly recovered courage. But soon again other thoughts came to her and filled her with gloom. \"Could it be that Rama gave up his life, unable to bear my loss? It might well be so. Otherwise, could he neglect me and leave me all alone these so many days? Indeed he is happy now and with the Gods. I must have been guilty of many sins to be thus left to suffer. My heart must be made of stone. How else can I suffer all this and yet survive? Yet something tells me that Rama is alive else I should be dead! Then again another thought occurred to her. \"Perhaps he has resolved to spend his life in penance and has laid aside all thought of me. No, no. How could a warrior forsake his duty and, leaving his wife in the hands of his foe, take up the life of sanyasa? How foolish of me even to think of this! The fact is that they do not know where I am. Could it be that Rama has lost his love for me? \\'Out of sight, out of mind,\\' they say. Could it be that he has forgotten me? Fie, fie! What a sinful thought! How can my Rama forget me? He never can. And what wrong have I committed that he should cease to think of me? This cannot be the reason. Perhaps Ravana has played some trick and treacherously slain the prince. Thus her mind wandered from one sad thought to another and sank ever deeper in the sea of sorrow. She decided that it was best by hanging herself. She could hang herself with her long braid of hair round her neck and jump down from a branch of the Simsupa tree. Having failed in their attempt to persuade Sita, the Rakshasis did not know what to do next. Some went to inform Ravana of their failure. Some stayed behind to look after Sita. Appearing among them Trijata, a Rakshasi, reprimanded them, saying: \"O foolish ones, you are talking nonsense! Listen to me, I shall tell you of a dream that I dreamt. The time has come when Lanka shall be destroyed.\" Then she proceeded to recount in detail the terrible dream that she had dreamt: \"I saw in my dream Rama, shining like a sun, come to Lanka to find Sita. I saw Ravana entering the abode of Yama. I saw Rama mounting Sita on his elephant and carrying her home. I saw Ravana and all the Rakshasas, clad in soiled garments and dragged away by Yama.\" Relating this dream to the Rakshasis, Trijata warned them: \"Don\\'t persecute this saintly woman.

The little Bachelor suddenly grew in size into Trivikrama and with one step measured the earth and with another the entire heavens. And there being no room left for the third step that had been granted, he set his foot on Mahabali's devoted head. In the eyes of God, the head of a bhakta is as wide as the earth or the heavens. And Mahabali, whose head was blessed by the touch of Narayana's foot, became one of the seven immortals of the world.\\nAfter narrating the story of Mahabali, Viswamitra added: 'This is where at first Narayana and later Kashyapa performed tapas, resulting in the incarnation of God as Vamana.

Your coming here is to end this evil.'\\n'So be it,' said Rama.\\nThe arrival of Viswamitra and the two princes was a signal for rejoicing at the ashrama. The rishis offered water and fruits according to custom. Rama told Viswamitra that he might begin the preparations for his yaga immediately and Viswamitra took the vows that very night. Getting up very early the next morning, the princes went to Viswamitra and asked when the Rakshasas were expected so that they might hold themselves in readiness to receive them. Viswamitra was under a vow of silence, and could not answer, but the rishis, his juniors, told the princes that they should be ceaselessly vigilant for six nights and days to safeguard the sacrifice. The princes, fully armed, kept vigil for six days and nights. On the morning of the sixth day Rama told Lakshmana: 'Brother, now is the time for the enemies to come. Let us be wary.' Even as he was saying this, flames shot up from the sacrificial fire, for Agni, the God of Fire, knew that the Rakshasas had arrived. As the rites were being performed, there was heard from the sky a great roar. Rama looked up and saw Maricha and Subahu and their followers preparing to shower unclean things on the sacrificial fire. The army of Rakshasas covered the sky like a great black cloud. Rama said, 'Look Lakshmana,' and let go the Manavastra at Maricha. As was intended, it did not kill Maricha, but wrapping him up in resistless force hurled him a full hundred yojanas near the sea. With the Agneyastra Rama killed Subahu; and then the two princes utterly destroyed the entire army of Rakshasas. The sky was bright again. Viswamitra was supremely happy at the completion of his yaga. 'I am grateful to King Dasaratha,' he said. 'You have fulfilled the promise, princes. I admire your fortitude. This ashrama has through you become again a scene of success, Siddhashrama.' (Siddha means success). The next day, Rama and Lakshmana, after their morning prayers, went to Viswamitra and asked for further orders. The purpose of Rama's birth was not unknown to Sage Viswamitra.

THE BROTHERS MEET WHILE Bharata was thus engaged in trying to undo the mischief wrought by others, in the forest hut at Chitrakuta, life went on fairly cheerfully. With Lakshmana and Sita by his side, Rama lacked nothing. The grandeur of the mountain scenery and the forest and the sweet songs and play of the birds pleased his heart. He forgot the sorrow of his exile from kinsfolk and city. \"Look, Sita, at those birds playing,\" he would say. \"Look at that rock on the hill with the blue, yellow and red veins shining on it. Look at these plants and creepers with their flowers. We feared life in the forest, not knowing how pleasant it would be. I am so happy here. And I have in addition to this pleasure the feeling that I carry out my father\\'s promise. We have the joy of duty done besides leading a happy life here. Over and above all this, I am happy that my brother Bharata is ruling the kingdom. Thus Rama, free from sorrow himself, made Sita happy. Descending from the hill they would sometimes go to the river Mandakini and spend time there. \"Look at those sand hillocks,\" Rama would say. \"Look at the swans playing among the lotuses. The stream is as lovely as yourself, beloved. The fords where animals come to drink are beautifully red with new earth. Even the river in Kubera\\'s kingdom cannot be as beautiful as this. Sea the rishis bathing there and standing in supplication and offering hymns to the sun. Look at the flowers falling from the boughs on the water. Look at that pearl - scattering cascade. We are indeed lucky to be far away from the crowded city here in the forest. There, we cannot see rishis and pure souls such as we see here bathing everyday. This hill is our Ayodhya. The birds and beasts are our subjects. The Mandakini is our Sarayu. With you and Lakshmana by me, I am so happy and content. How pleasant it is to see the animals drinking water in the stream without any fear! Plunging in the water here, eating fruits and roots, walking about in the forest and climbing the hills, why should I think of kingdom or power? Thus, in the company of Sita and Lakshmana, Rama was spending happy days.',\n",

       " {'text': 'So ended Vali\\'s life. Owing to the protective virtue of Indra\\'s necklace, Rama could not have met Vali face to face and vanquished him, just as Ravana could not be conquered by the gods. Rama could kill Vali only when himself unseen. And still the question stands, why should Vali have been killed at all? Perhaps the answer is to be found in what Kabandha said to Rama in gratitude for being released from his curse. \"Through Sugriva\\'s friendship you will recover Sita,\" Sugriva\\'s help not Vali\\'s. And so Rama went in search of Sugriva, found him and pledged his friendship and consecrated it by fire. Sugriva had committed no unforgivable offence against Vali. Yet Vali, with his supernatural strength, persecuted his brother. Hearing the latter\\'s complaint, Rama had pledged his word to kill Vali and restore to Sugriva his wife and make him king as his part of the contract of alliance. Thereafter, Rama had no alternative. To kill Vali from cover became an inevitable necessity. Rama erred in running after the magic deer to please his wife. Consequent on this, difficulties and sorrows and conflicts of duty pursued him. If we keep in mind that when God takes a lower and limited form by His own ordinance, limitations follow and we should not be confused thereby. This is my humble view as against other explanations propounded by the pious. Tara\\'s grief. There was panic in Kishkindha when the news came that Vali had been slain by an archer, and the Vanaras fled hither and thither in hopeless confusion. Tara, seeing this, laid aside her own grief and like a queen put courage in her husband\\'s subjects saying: \"Till this day you walked before the King to battle! Why, then do you flee in fear now? There is no danger for you. Rama killed Vali only to make Sugriva king. Your lives are in no danger; you will only have a different ruler; that is all. You need not fly or fear.\" When she tried to go to the spot where her husband lay dead, the Vanaras stopped her saying: \"We shall crown Angada king and we shall make safe the fortress. We shall defend the town against Sugriva and his allies.\" But she said: \"Now my noble lord is dead, nothing matters.\" And boldly she went straight to where Rama and Lakshmana were standing. When she saw her husband lying wounded to death she could not control her sorrow. She sobbed and cried. \"Ah my hero!\" she wept embracing the wounded Vali. \"How many heroes have you laid low and now you lie low yourself! And you have left me here!\" Soon Vali\\'s son Angada reached the spot. And Sugriva, witnessing this scene, was filled with remorse at the thought that it was all for him that this calamity had happened. The remorse was no doubt genuine. For invariably revenge, especially revenge wreaked on those who have been friends in other day; brings nothing but bitterness and grief, and the momentary feeling of triumph is all ashes to the taste. How few of us realize this in the confusion created by desires and anger! Tara rolled on the ground and lamented: \"Leaving dear Angada an orphan and myself a helpless destitute you have gone on the journey from which there is no return. My Lord! My hero!\" Hanuman tried to console her: \"The dead reach their places in heaven. Why lament for Vali? Angada will be crowned in due course and we shall then rejoice.

He had fondly hoped that Kaikeyi would relent and that somehow the conflict of duties would be resolved. But now he saw that this was not to be. He had still one faint hope: \"Rama is in no way bound by my promises and pledges.

How can one put faith in a person who forsakes his own brother in his need?\" Valmiki records that on bearing these words of Sugriva, Rama turned to Lakshmana with a smile. Probably the smile was provoked by Sugriva\\'s forgetfulness of his own fraternal conduct in his indignant condemnation of Vibhishana! Rama said to Sugriva: \"I see what you mean. But listen. It is natural for kings to suspect brothers and neighbor kings. Good kings who entertain no such suspicion are exceptions. Most kings imagine that brothers envy them. What wonder then if Ravana suspected and insulted Vibhishana? It follows that Vibhishana feared danger to himself if he stayed on in Lanka. I conclude therefore that he has no sinister motive against us in coming here for refuge. Let us go further and grant that he has eyes on the kingdom, expecting Ravana\\'s defeat at our hands. Even in this ambition there is nothing wrong. Well, Lakshmana, can we expect all people to be like our Bharata?\" Having said this, Rama was silent for a moment, lost in remembrance of Bharata\\'s selfless love. Then he spoke: \"Who in the world is as lucky as I am? Who has a brother like Bharata? And what a father I had! His love for me was so great that his life fled when I came away to the forest. And my friends, who else is blessed like me with friends such as you?\" Having spoken thus he wiped the tears in his eyes, and went back to the subject on hand. \"I see no point in the argument that Vibhishana will forsake us, as he has forsaken his brother. He had cause for forsaking his brother, and can have none for leaving us. We do not want Lanka, and if, as is natural, he wants it, he can get it only through our victory. From the point of view of policy, it would be a mistake to reject Vibhishana. \"But there is a stronger reason. When one comes to me for refuge, I cannot reject him. This is my dharma. It does not matter if as a result of this I suffer. Even at the cost of life I must do this duty of mine. Never can I deviate from it. Verily, I tell you, even if Ravana himself came to me for sanctuary, I would accept him without hesitation. How then can I reject his brother who has done me no wrong? Go and fetch Vibhishana.\" \"My Lord Rama! It is wonderful how clearly the right stands out demonstrated when you speak!\" said Sugriva. \"I see things clearly now. I shall go and bring Vibhishana. May he too become a loving friend of yours, even like us!\" And Sugriva went to fetch Vibhishana. In the Vaishnava tradition, this, episode, in which Vibhishana is taken by the prince into his camp and innermost council, is held to be as important as the Bhagavad Gita episode in the Mahabharata. It illustrates the doctrine that the Lord accepts all who in absolute surrender seek shelter at his feet, regardless of their merits or defects. Their sins are burnt out by the mere act of surrender. This is a message of hope to erring humanity. It is the heart of the Vaishnava faith that there is hope for the worst of us if only we surrender ourselves to the Lord. But why should I restrict this doctrine to the Vaishnava tradition? Is not this the heart of all the religious traditions in our land, yes, and of all the religions in the world?

They approached him with music playing on many instruments. All this pained him. He stopped the musicians and sent the messengers back and told Satrughna: 'Why should they still persist in tormenting me when I have refused the kingdom? This is the result of our mother's intrigue.

Tears fell from his eyes. The young prince wept aloud in the midst of the royal Assembly and in a voice struggling with tears, he addressed words of respectful reproach to the preceptors: 'How can you ask one of my race and upbringing to usurp what belongs to another far nobler and more worthy than I? Can any son of Dasaratha possibly dream of such iniquity? This kingdom and I, and all else in it belong to Rama. He is the eldest son, the noblest among us, a lover of dharma, an equal to Dilipa and Nahusha of old. He is the rightful king. He is fit to be sovereign in the three worlds. Standing here I pay my homage to Rama there in the forest. He is the King, not I.' The Assembly burst into tears of joy when they heard Bharata speak thus. And Bharata continued: 'If I am unable to persuade King Rama to agree, I shall stay there performing penance. It is your duty, O Elders, to use every means to bring Rama back. I shall do all I can to make Rama come back to Ayodhya and make him King.' He then ordered Sumantra who was standing near him to hasten the preparations for going to the forest.

These missiles of power disturbed the sea to its depths carrying death and dismay to all it contained and presently the tortured waters began to exhale steam in their agony. It looked as though Rama in his wrath would convert the sea with its infinitude of waters into a desert of blazing dust bereft of all life. The sea -god could stand it no longer. Shining like the rising sun behind Mount Meru, he appeared and stood before Rama. With folded hands he said: \"My Lord Ramachandra! I am subject to the laws of nature like the earth, the air, space, light, and all constituents of the universe. How can I depart fro m my nature, which is to be vast, deep, wave - filled, and impassable? But this I can do. Ask the Vanaras to bring boulders and trees to build a causeway. I shall permit it. I shall help you by receiving and keeping in place the rocks and trees. This is all that I can do and I shall also show the most favorable place for this causeway. There is Nala, son of Viswakarma, with you, who has the ability to build this path. May victory be yours.\" Rama, true to his nature, graciously accepted the sea god\\'s apology a nd offer of help. And then, ordered by Rama, they all began to work. Thousands of Vanaras went at it with enthusiasm and soon finished building the causeway. Valmiki describes the work at length. He sings with gusto of the noise and confusion of the gigantic project. The Vanaras went to the mountains and forests and, plucking rocks and trees, dragged them to the shore. The bigger Vanaras brought big boulders and threw them into the sea. As they fell down, the water splashed up sky -high. Nala stood and supervised their labors. The leaders in charge of companies kept them active. On top of the rocks and trees, when the base was firm, a dressing of grass and little pieces of wood was given to produce a level surface. The noise raised by the dam -builders drowned the roar of the ocean. The construction was complete. The new path shone across the sea like the milky way in the sky. Hosts of gods above rejoiced, as hosts of Vanaras shouted below in exultation. The gods and the rishis uttered benedictions. Then they went on the causeway. Hanuman carried Rama on his shoulders and Angada carried Lakshmana on his. The Vanara army crossed the sea. There is a principle expounded here. As Rama stood bow in hand, the ocean -god bowed before him with clasped bands and said: \"Dear Ramachandra! Earth, air, ether, water, fire, these five elements must follow the eternal laws of their nature. Tempted by pleasure or reward or frightened of punishment, can I ever swerve from my nature? Can water harden and become stone? Or can I r educe my depths into a shallow pond for your easy crossing?\" Thus the ocean king protested with all politeness to Sri Rama. Valmiki puts into the mouth of the ocean king a fundamental of our religious philosophy.',\n",

He wondered then why the army was marching and thought that perhaps Dasaratha was coming to visit them in the forest and a large retinue followed the King. The commentator remarks that Lakshmana, realising his folly in having spoken ill of Bharata, was trying by some explanations to cover up his shame. Rama cheered up Lakshmana saying: \"Yes, it may be as you say. Thinking that life in the forest was hard, the King might have come to take us, and specially Sita, back to the city. But then, we do not see the King\\'s great white umbrella. But whatever be the case, you should be calm.\" Lakshmana stood humbly with folded hands by Rama. Halting the army at some distance, Bharata sent a few men to observe and report on the place whence the smoke rose. They brought the news that this was the very spot described by Bharadwaja and that the cottage was very probably Rama\\'s forest abode. Bharata started forward with Satrughna, Vasishtha and Sumantra. As they advanced, they saw indications that the ashrama was habited. There was a path that led to the river and the trees were blazed on either side of it as though to make it easy to find it in the dusk. Presently they came to a cottage thatched with leaves, near which were stacks of faggots and the dry dung of deer and wild buffaloes heaped for use in winter. In the cottage, on the walls were mighty bows and quivers full of deadly arrows, swords which seemed to radiate victory and other weapons all of superlative excellence. They saw also, spread out to dry on the branches of trees, garments of bark. Bharata beheld all these sure signs of his brothers\\' residence in the hermitage with a swelling heart. From inside came smoke from the oblations of daily worship. Entering, Bharata saw the altar with its blazing fire and Rama himself seated by it with matted locks, majestic, though in deer-skin and bark, a ruler of the world, with his mighty arms, breadth of chest and a countenance made to command love and obedience. By him were Sita and Lakshmana. He had been thinking all the time of the infamy that had gathered on his head, and wondering what to say and what to do when he met Rama. But now when he saw Rama, he forgot all this in the great love that surged within him and submerged all other thoughts and fears. He sprang forward to the spot where Rama was seated. He could utter no word, beyond \"Brother,\" and fell at his feet, and sobbed. By this time, Sumantra and Guha joined him. Rama saw before him lying on the ground Bharata with hands clasped in supplication, with matted locks and in garments of bark. With grief and fasting, his body had grown lean and he was tanned with fatigue and exposure. Rama embraced him, and kissed him on the head, and said: \"Brother beloved, why did you leave our father\\'s side and come all this way into the forest? And why have you grown so thin?\" Bharata was speechless. Rama put to him the formal questions which members of the royal family asked each other when they met after an absence.

We have heard it said that horses are sharp of hearing. Listen to us then and bring back our Rama.\"\\nHearing these words of yearning from old Brahmanas, Rama stopped the chariot. The three descended from it and went forward walking. The common people, leading citizens and wise elders, men of penance, why, even the birds on wings, tried to prevent Rama from going to the forest. The river Tamasa, says the poet, seemed to conspire with them, for now it flowed across his path. The chariot stopped on the riverbank. Sumantra unyoked and watered the horses and let them loose to graze. Rama said: \"Lakshmana, this is the first night of our forest life. Let us spend it on the bank of this holy river. Life in the forest holds no hardship, as you and I know. Look, the birds, the animals and even the trees seem to sympathise with us. The only pain is when we think of the grief of our parents in Ayodhya, though I feel reassured as I think of Bharata\\'s nobility and goodness. He will assuredly tend our parents with true affection. Sumantra, go, look after the horses. Then, Rama offered the evening prayers by the river and said: \"Let us fast on this first night of our forest life, Lakshmana. Your presence by my side rids me of all care. Lakshmana spread some grass on the ground for Rama and Sita to sleep on but he himself spent the night in vigil talking with Sumantra. Long before dawn Rama rose from sleep and told Sumantra: \"The citizens who have followed us, fatigued by their long journey, are fast asleep. I am deeply moved by their affection; but I cannot permit their love to force me to go back. Let us therefore, move on even now, while they are yet asleep. The horses were harnessed and the chariot slowly crossed the river. Standing on the southern bank, Rama told Sumantra: \"If you take the chariot to the other shore, where the people are asleep, and drive it for a little distance towards Ayodhya and then bring it back to this side, we can proceed on our journey before they wake up. They will see the track of the chariot going towards the city, and thinking that we have returned home, may themselves go back. Unless you do this the crowd will go on following us.\" Sumantra did this and, when the chariot returned, the three got into it again and proceeded southwards. 19. ALONE BY THEMSELVES The citizens who had slept on the bank of the Tamasa woke up in the morning and looked round. They were surprised to see that Rama and the chariot had disappeared. They followed the track of the chariot-wheels but were disappointed to find that it was lost in the main road to the capital. They returned home to their own houses and sought satisfaction in reviling Kaikeyi. Without Rama, the city was bereft of beauty and wrapped in gloom.

In this poem Milton delineates the Almighty and Jesus, His spiritual son and human incarnation, as well as several orders of angels. But the most impressive character in the great epic is Satan who rebelled against God and brought sin and death into this world. Critics of English poetry admire Milton\\'s wonderful success in the characterisation of Satan. Similarly, the great dramatic poet Shakespeare has created a wonderful character in Shylock, the usurer and miser. Even such embodiments of despicable qualities are presented by the poets as possessing courage, determination, energy and other good qualities that attract us and serve as a bright background to their blackness. In Valmiki\\'s portraits of Ravana and Kumbhakarna too, we notice the same artistic skill. The cook who meets all tastes shows his skill in making out of bitter vegetables an attractive dish. So does the poet show his skill in portraying evil. The Rakshasa king was somewhat ashamed and afraid at the thought of what Hanuman had achieved in Lanka. He summoned his ministers and took counsel with them. He began in an apologetic tone. \"What has happened is something strange and unexpected. No one has till now been known to enter our city, but this envoy of Rama has not only entered Lanka, he has met and talked with the imprisoned Sita. He has destroyed temples and palaces. He has slain some of our best warriors. He has filled our people with fear. And this thing is not likely to stop here. Hence we have to consider what should be done. You know that the king should decide his course of action only after consulting his loyal ministers of clear vision and well-versed in statecraft. And so I have summoned this Council. Rama has become an inveterate enemy. Let us consider what we should do about it. The king has no use for ministers who are not straight forward or who not knowing their own minds wobble in their advice. The matter before us is most important. Rama is strong, and so is his army. It is certain that they will contrive somehow to cross the sea. It would be unwise to trust to that single defence. Consider well and tell me how we can strengthen and secure our city and army and what steps we should take to defend ourselves.\" After listening to the king, the members of the Assembly spoke with one voice. \"Great king! Knowing well that our army and our weapons are the strongest in the world, why need you be anxious? Where is the enemy who dares to attack your fortress and who can oppose your army with any hope of success? The world knows your might. Did you not invade the city of Bhogavati and defeat the Naga king? Did you not attack powerful Kubera and defeat him and his Yakshas and capture his Pushpaka Vimana as well as this island of Lanka? Did not Maya in fear of you sue for your favor and friendship and give you his daughter in marriage? How many cities in the nether region have you not attacked and taken?

The chariot of Indrajit was destroyed in the course of the combat and both the heroes stood on the ground and continued the battle. At last, Lakshmana used the Indra-astra spell and uttering the name of Rama discharged the fatal arrow. The head of Indrajit was severed and fell to the ground and as it fell, it shone like fire. The Devas and Gandharvas showered flowers from the heavens. Lakshmana then went to Rama. He was wounded all over and bleeding. He walked slowly, supported by Jambavan and Hanuman. Rama had already heard the news of the death of Indrajit. \"Lakshmana!\" he cried, \"this is the end of the Rakshasa race. You have achieved it.\" Lakshmana modestly stood back but Rama seated him on his lap, kissed his head and gave vent to his joy. \"You have performed a mighty deed, impossible for anyone else. You have deprived Ravana of his right hand. Who in the world can equal you or Vibhishana or Hanuman? I have no more care. You have vanquished the conqueror of Indra. I feel I have already recovered Sita.\" The news reached Ravana that Indrajit had been slain by Lakshmana. When he heard that Vibhishana helped Lakshmana in slaying Indrajit, his grief and anger swelled and the tears he shed burnt where they fell. And from his mouth issued fire. \"Alas, my son! O peerless warrior! O hero! Vanquisher of the great Indra! Has Death won after all? Have you entered the heaven of heroes? But I should not grieve,\" he said. But the father\\'s heart would not thus be denied, and again he cried: \"What! Is Indrajit gone? The world is now empty for me.

It is best to kill Sita, the cause of all this tragedy. My son killed the maya-Sita. Now I shall kill the real Sita herself.\" So saying he rushed out, sword in hand, intending to do it. Some fierce Rakshasas, seeing Ravana issuing out in anger, applauded him with joy; but the minister Suparsva was horrified and appealed to Ravana\\'s better sense and what was due to himself as a man and a king. \"King!\" he cried, \"how dare you think such a thought? How can you do it? Oh, Lord of ten heads! Brother of Kubera! Are you thinking to kill a woman? Are you going to incur this shame and sin? Can you thus be tempted by anger?

It will be new moon tomorrow. Gather all your armies, issue out of Lanka, slay Rama and Lakshmana and achieve victory. Then take Sita. Put on the armor you have secured from Brahma. Ascend your chariot and go to battle. Ravana felt that Suparsva was right and his words were good. Seated on his throne, he was silent for a while, lost in profound meditation.

It is a pity that some people in their ignorance identify the Asura s and Rakshasas with ancient Indian tribes and races, a view not supported by any literary work or tradition or recorded history. The conjecture of foreigners that the Rakshasas were the Dravidian race, is not borne out by any authority in Tamil or other l iterature. The Tamil people are not descendants of the Asuras or Rakshasas. The Devas were generally upholders of dharma and took on themselves the task of putting down the Rakshasas. According to the Puranas, they had at times to deviate from dharma in dealing with the Rakshasas, some of whom had attained great power through tapas. The Devas were generally good; and those among them who swerved from the path of righteousness paid the price for it. There was no separate code of conduct for the Devas; the la w of Karma admits of no distinction between the Devas and others. The law dealt with the Devas as with others. Wedded to virtue as the Devas generally were, lapses on their part appear big to us, like stains on white cloth. The Rakshasas\\' evil deeds are ta ken for granted and do not attract much attention, like stains on black cloth. The honest, when they happen to go astray, should evoke our sympathy. It is however the way of the world, but it is not right, to condemn in strong terms casual lapses of the vi rtuous, while tolerating habitual wrong -doers. It should be noted that in the Puranas we see the gods getting entangled in dilemmas of Dharma. Indra and other Devas are shown often as committing serious sins. Why did the sages who told the Puranas involve themselves in such difficulties? Their aim was to awaken people to a sense of the dangers of adharma. Else, the sages need not have deliberately attributed sinful acts to their own heroes and created difficulties for themselves. Some persons take pleasure in jumping to wrong conclusions from the incidents in the Puranas. They argue: \"Ravana was a very good king. Valmiki has falsely accused him of wicked deeds.\" They ask: \"Did not Rama act unjustly on a certain occasion? Did not Sita utter a lie?\" and the like. Valmiki could well have omitted incidents which are not edifying. Both Rama and Ravana were first presented to us by the poet Valmiki. There was no earlier work referring to Ravana that can be quoted to contradict Valmiki and stamp him as being partial to Rama, Sita and the Devas, and twisting facts to deceive people. Valmiki\\'s Ramayana is the fountain source of the story of Rama; in it, one comes across seemingly wrong deeds. Calm consideration of such situations would show that they are just portrayal s of similar difficulties in our day -to-day life. It is for us to benefit from the moral trials contained in them. The lesson of the Ahalya episode is that, however deadly one\\'s sin, one may hope to be freed from its consequence by penitence and punishment. Instead of condemning others for their sins, we should look within our own hearts and try to purify them of every evil thought. The best of us have need for eternal vigilance, if we would escape sin. This is the moral of Ahalya\\'s error. 9. RAMA WINS SITA \\'S HAND All arrangements for Janaka\\'s yaga had been completed and to Mithila had come many rishis and Brahman\\'s from various kingdoms.

We see that all the efforts of Lakshmana to console him had no effect. Our common human dharma is illustrated by the sorrow of Rama. We see here the picture of true and equal love between a virtuous man and woman and the anguish of loss. The episode may also be interpreted allegorically. Rama\\'s sense of privation, when he misses Sita, is a measure and image of the mind of God whe n a single human soul is lost through sin. One may ask whether God can lose, or can suffer pain of mind. If one realises that all life is divine leela, the play of God, no further exegesis is needed. Sin, merit, devotion, all are aspects of that sport. Each one of us is beloved of the Lord. If for any reason we are swept away from the right path, He suffers like a lover who has lost his love. And His sorrow too is a part of His great play. 39. A SECOND FATHER DIES THE two brothers searched every mountain, forest and riverbank calling Sita\\'s name aloud. But all in vain, and they did not so much as find a clue anywhere. Baffled and grief -stricken, Rama cried out against the river Godavari, against the gods and against the five elements. The poet sage ascribes the silence of the rivers and the gods and elements to their fear of the powerful Rakshasa king. A herd of deer, however, moving southwards seemed to indicate to Rama and Lakshmana that they too should travel in the same direction. They did so and, after a time, found some flowers scattered on the way. Rama at once recognised the flowers and cried excitedly: \"These are the very flowers I gave her. They must have fallen from her hair.\" His grief and anxiety grew greater and he sobbed aloud fearing the worst for Sita. They searched the forest all around the spot where they found the flowers. They noticed the marks of a Rakshasa\\'s big feet and little footprints that they knew were Sita\\'s. They found some gold beads spilt from Sita\\'s jewels. Rama cried again: \" Look! The Rakshasa has been chasing her like a beast of prey to tear her tender flesh!\" Then they saw several fragments of a chariot and great clots of blood, as also royal headgear and jewels scattered on the ground. They wondered what these things could mean. Soon they came upon a large bow broken, flag torn and armor crushed. A little later they saw the dead bodies of a charioteer and of mules. It was clear that a vehement battle had been fought on that spot. \"Two powerful Rakshasas must have struggled h ere,\" groaned Rama, \"each claiming the sole right to eat Sita.\" Conjecturing and lamenting in this way, Rama went on: \"Dharma could not save Sita! No god came to her rescue! It will be right to destroy this wicked world.\" Rama was beside himself and talked wildly. Lakshmana did his best to calm the distracted Rama. \"Great sorrow unbalances all minds, even the strongest,\" he said. \"Else why should you thus lose self-control? Why should you hate and curse the whole world for the evil deed of one person? How often have you, my brother, calmed my anger and led me on the right path!

He resumed his seat on the stone-battlement on the top of the garden-gate. Hearing of the defeat of the force sent to capture Hanuman and the slaughter of five of his best commanders, fear for the first time entered Ravana's heart. 'It is extraordinary that a solitary monkey should have this devastating valor and purposeful malevolence,' Ravana thought with anxiety. 'This is clearly a conspiracy of the gods.' But he kept his concern to himself and laughed derisively. He looked round at all the members of his great council. His son the heroic Aksha stood foremost, eager for battle, and the proud father bade him go forth to battle against the tremendous foe. Radiant with youth and health and glowing with high courage at this opportunity of distinguishing himself, Aksha went forth in a shining chariot, confident of victory. HANUMAN BOUND VALMIKI describes in beautiful verses how the youthful warrior Aksha, the equal of the gods, rode to battle in a chariot drawn by eight horses. Who can put up in a different tongue Valmiki's poetry describing the beauty of forests and the terrible fury of encounters between warriors? The rhythm and grandeur of his words convey the terror and majesty of what he describes. This power is Valmiki's special gift. We can only summarise in pedestrian prose his glowing account, of the battle between Aksha, the beloved son of Ravana, and Hanuman. In a golden chariot acquired through tapasya rode Ravana's young son. When he saw Hanuman, seated on the stone battlement above the gateway, and noted approvingly the beautiful symmetry of his mighty limbs, and the majestic intrepidity of his look, Aksha felt that here was a foe worthy of his steel. He summoned all his strength and resolution to do him honor. The young warrior aimed three sharp arrows at Hanuman. They struck his body and drew blood. But Maruti's strength increased and his face shone with new splendor. He too was pleased with the prowess of the youthful Rakshasa. Fierce grew the battle between the two. Hundreds of arrows rose in clouds into the sky and hit Maruti. Like rain falling on a rock, they fell on Hanuman's body. Rising in the air Hanuman dodged about evading the arrows. Slipping as it were through the meshes of that deadly network of missiles and finding a favorable opening closed with Aksha. Hanuman admired Aksha's youthful promise and heroism, and was sorry to have to slay him, but there was no help for it for the prince seemed to get more and more formidable as the fight went on. And it was unwise to take chances with him. At last Hanuman hardened his heart and decided to destroy the youth. He rushed against Aksha's chariot and broke it to pieces. The horses fell dead. The Rakshasa prince stood on the ground chariotless. Nothing daunted, he rose in the air with bow and sword and attacked Hanuman. A great battle took place in the air. In the end Aksha's bones were crushed and splintered and he fell down dead. Hearing that the prince had been killed by Hanuman, Ravana shook with rage, but controlling himself he called his son Indrajit, the conqueror of Indra. 'You have mastered all weapons,' he said.

They achieved great success in the distribution of my Mahabharata book and I trust this book of the s tory of Rama and Sita will receive similar welcome. Once again, I repeat my confession that in the evening of my busy life during a great and eventful period of Indian history, the writing of these two books wherein I have retold the Mahabharata and Ramaya na, is, in my opinion, the best service I have rendered to my people. At any rate, they embody the best joy I have experienced; for in these two books I helped our great sages to speak to our dear men and women again in their own language, elevating their minds through the sorrows borne by Kunti, Kausalya, Draupadi and Sita. The real need of the hour is a recommunion between us and the sages of our land, so that the future may be built on rock and not on sand. In presenting this English version to a wider c ircle of readers spread all over the world, I think I am presenting to them the people of Bharat just as they are, with all their virtues and their faults. Our classics really embody our national character in all its aspects and it is well the world sees u s as we really are, apart from what we wish to become. The Ramayana is not history or biography. It is a part of Hindu mythology. One cannot understand Hindu dharma unless one knows Rama and Sita, Bharata, Lakshmana, Ravana, Kumbhakarna and Hanuman. Mythol ogy cannot be dispensed with. Philosophy alone or rituals alone or mythology alone cannot be sufficient. These are the three stands of all ancient religions. The attitude towards things spiritual which belongs to a particular people cannot be grasped or preserved or conveyed unless we have all these three. The Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan has achieved great work by the very wide distribution organised by it of my Ramayana and Mahabharata books, which seek to bring Valmiki and Vyasa near to those who have no acce ss to the unrivalled original classics. The characters and incidents of these two itihasas have come to be the raw material for the works of numerous poets and saints that came later to write dramas and sing poems and hymns to keep this nation in the strai ght path. Oral discourses have further played with them in order to entertain and instruct pious audiences and not a few variations and additions have been made to the original. All the languages of India have the Ramayana and Mahabharata retold by their p oets, with additions and variations of their own. They are the records of the mind and spirit of our forefathers who cared for the good, ever so much more than for the pleasant and who saw more of the mystery of life than we can do in our interminable purs uit for petty and illusory achievements ill the material plane. We should be thankful to those who preserved for us these many centuries -old epics in spite of all the vicissitudes through which our nation passed since Vyasa and Valmiki's time. Even the poe ts who wrote these epics in the original did not create but built out of the inherited bricks of national memory prior to their own time. Reading the Ramayana and Mahabharata even in the form I have given them, we go back to live with our ancient forbears and listen to their grand voice.\",\n",

I shall fly in the sky and cross the sea.\" With this resolve he offered worship and prayer to Surya, Indra, Vayu, Brahma, and all creation. Then facing east, he made obeisance to his father Vayu and, magnifying his frame still fu rther, turned towards the south. He pressed the hill with his feet and struck it with his hands. At this impact the flowers fell from the trees and covered the hill. Squeezed irresistibly by the pressure of his feet the hill threw out springs of water, lik e the rut flowing down the cheeks of the elephant. Many colored veins of ore burst out of the rock. From the caves the beasts emerged with panic - stricken outcries. Hooded serpents emitting venom bit the rock and sparks flew out. The hair of Hanuman\\'s body  stood on end and he roared and lashed his tail on the ground. He contracted his hind parts, held his breath, pressed down his feet, folded his ears and stiffened his muscles. Then with a roar of triumph he rose into the sky and like Garuda flew with the speed of Rama\\'s arrow. With the momentum of his speed, many trees were uprooted and followed in his wake. Like friends who speed a parting guest, they accompanied him a little way, showering down their flowers, and dropped. One by one the trees that follow ed Hanuman fell into the sea like the mountains which of old were pursued by Indra and denuded of their wings. Covered with bright -colored flowers the sea shone like the sky with its stars. Hanuman\\'s arms with their outspread hands as he flew through the s ky appeared like two five headed cobras. He seemed to swallow the sky as he flew forward. His eyes glistened like mountain forests on fire. His red nose shone like the evening sun. His huge frame spanned the sky like an enormous comet. The air roared as h e sped fast. Beneath him his shadow travelled like a ship on the sea. It looked as though a huge mountain with wings was flying in the sky. Hidden at times by clouds and again emerging from them, he shone like the moon sailing across the sky. The Gandharva s showered flowers. The Devarishis blessed him. With courage equal to every occasion, with foresight, skill and resolution, Hanuman met and survived the trials on the way. Shooting up suddenly from the sea, a mighty mountain rose and stood, in his way. Ha numan struck it with his chest and the Mynaka Mountain yielded, like a cloud struck by the wind. The mountain said: \"My son, I am Mount Mynaka. My king Ocean bade me help Sri Rama, the descendant of the Sagara race. The Ocean is an old friend of that race . In honor of that ancient, association, stay here on me for a while. You will fulfil Rama\\'s purpose all the better for this rest. When Indra struck with his thunder all the hills, I fled from his persecution and hid myself in the ocean and survived. The O cean who gave me shelter now bids me help you. The sons of Sagara dug and deepened the ocean. Did not your father Vayu help me to escape from Indra\\'s thunderbolt and find sanctuary in the sea? Both the Ocean and myself will be pleased if you will accept my hospitality and rest here for a while.\" But Hanuman could not yield to Mynaka\\'s importunity and said politely: \"I cannot stop, my friend.

They proceeded along the bank, admiring the beauty of the river. Finding a spot of surpassing charm, Rama said: \"We shall spend the night here.\" Untying the horses, they sat under a tree. Guha, the chief of the region, having learnt already from his men that Rama would be coming there, came forward with his retinue to greet Rama and Lakshmana. He had unbounded love for the royal family and for Rama. Being the chieftain of the tribes who dwelt on the banks of Ganga, he was a man of great prestige and power. Rama and Lakshmana rose to greet Guha, even while the latter was still at some distance from them. Guha welcomed them with a hearty embrace, saying: \"Regard this land as your own. This place is as much yours as is Ayodhya. Who can hope to have a guest like you? It is indeed my good fortune.\" Guha had prepared a lavish entertainment. He said, \"Feel perfectly at home and happy in my kingdom. You may spend all the fourteen years with us here. You will not lack anything I assure you. Looking after you will be a pleasure and privilege to me. Be gracious enough to accept my hospitality.\" Warmly embracing Guha again, Rama said: \"Brother, I know how deep is your love for me. Your wish is itself as good as hospitality rendered. I am bound by my vows and must refuse anything more. I have come to dwell in the forest and not to enjoy life as a chieftain\\'s guest. These horses are my dear father\\'s favorites. Pray feed them well. We shall be content with simple food and rest for the night.\" They lay under the tree for the night. Guha and Lakshmana kept awake, conversing with Sumantra. Said Guha to Lakshmana: \"Brother, do go and rest. There is a bed made ready for you. My men will keep careful watch. None dare do anything in the forest unknown to me. Have no anxiety regarding Rama. Do sleep.\" Lakshmana replied: \"How can I find sleep, Guha? Here, lying on the bare ground, is Sita, daughter of the great Janaka and daughter -in-law of the great Dasaratha. The great Purushottama himself who could subdue the three worlds lies stretched on the grass. How can I sleep who sees this? I wonder how Ayodhya is bearing it. The queens\\' apartments must be loud with wailing. I even doubt if at this moment Kausalya and my mother are alive.

And if he has passed away, our mothers too will have given up their lives. And here we are, deprived even of the privilege of doing the last offices to the dead. In any case it is hardly possible that our father and mothers will be alive to greet us, when we return to Ayodhya after our term in the forest.\" Thus spoke Lakshmana in sorrow. Guha was in tears.

I have been without food for a long time and am eagerly waiting for you,\" and the monster opened its mouth wide like a cave. Hanuman answered: \"I am bent on doing Rama\\'s purpose. Do not stop me.\" \"Impossible!\" said the monster. \"You must enter my mouth.\" Hanuman thought quickly and decided what to do. Step by step he made his body grow bigger and bigger. The Rakshasa form (which had been assumed by Surasa, the Naga maiden) opened its mouth correspondingly wider and wider. When the mouth was thus enormously wide, all of a sudden Hanuman contracted his body into a speck and, darting through the demon\\'s mouth and body, came out again and resumed his former normal shape. He then laughed and said: \"You have had your wish, mother. I have entered your mouth. What more do you need?\" And the Naga goddess blessed him saying: \"Your effort will be crowned with success. I did this at the bidding of the gods who wanted to test you. Rama\\'s purpose, which you seek to serve, will assuredly triumph.\" This was not the last of his trials. As he was flying in the sky, for no reason which he could discover, he found his speed obstructed and he suffered like a ship against a contrary wind. Some mighty force, he felt, was holding him and dragging him down. He looked up and down and on all four sides. Then he discovered the cause. It was a huge she-demon in the sea holding him by his shadow below, arresting his speed, and dragging him down. The demon, holding him by his shadow, said: \"Come, come! Long have I been waiting for you. No longer can I bear my hunger,\" and she opened her mouth like a cave. At once Hanuman entered her mouth and ripped a way out through her entrails and emerged. The demon died and sank down in the water. Like the full moon emerging from an eclipse, Hanuman shone in the sky and resumed his journey. Thus surviving many trials with the help of his subtle wit, courage and strength, he flew across the ocean and approached the coast of Lanka covered with plantain and coconut trees. On the shore of the island he saw groves and mountains and forests and the mouths of rivers. Hanuman saw the wealth of Ravana\\'s kingdom and the beauty of the fortified city. \"I have reached the destination,\" said Hanuman to himself. \"Now without letting the Rakshasas know who or what I am, I must search the place and find out where Sita is kept.\" He reduced his huge form to the size of a normal monkey and alighted on a hilltop in Lanka. 48. THE SEARCH IN LANKA FULL of hope, Hanuman alighted and set foot in Lanka. But soon the flush of triumph at the accomplishment of the journey gave place to sober thinking. \"True I have crossed the sea, but that is only the beginning of my mission.

The city and the fortress are not inferior to Amaravati or Bhagavati.

O friend and messenger of Rama! How did you first meet Rama? How did the Prince make friends with the Vanaras? Tell me all\". To confirm her faith, Hanuman recounted once again the virtues and attractive qualities of Rama and Lakshmana. He said: \"What wonder is there in Rama becoming friends with me and my king and the Vanaras when the whole world lives and finds bliss by his loving kindness?\" He proceeded to describe fully how the quarrel arose between Vali and Sugriva, how the latter first met Rama and Lakshmana, how they became friends, how Rama promised to slay Vali and secure the Vanara kingdom for Sugriva, how the Vanaras had picked up and preserved the jewels dropped by Sita, how with mounting sorrow Rama recognised them, how Vali was slain and Sugriva crowned, how after the rainy season was over the Vanara hosts searched the whole world for Sita, how the party led by Angada and proceeding south having failed to find her, decided to fast to death, how they met Sampati and received a clue from him, how he, Hanuman, crossed the sea and searched the inner apartments of Ravana, all this he recounted. At the end of the narration he placed in her hand Rama\\'s signet ring that he had brought. Sita received the ring and pressed it to her eyes with joy. Now all fear of Ravana\\'s deceit and Rakshasa magic was over. She had complete faith in Hanuman and infinite affection for him. \"My child!\" she said, \"how foolish was my error!

Sita forgot her own suffering thinking of Rama\\'s grief. 53. SITA AND HANUMAN \"DEAR , dear Vanara friend,\" said Sita, \"I do not know whether to rejoice or grieve at the news you have brought.

Sita was consoled but also pained by the thought that Rama had not forgotten her, but was thinking of her, grieving and searching for her. \"We are puppets manipulated by the twin strings of joy and sorrow\", said Sita. \"None of us can escape their pull.

What a fool am I to search for her in this company! This is no place for her. Then he went elsewhere. In another chamber he saw many beds.

The shapeliness of  her limbs and the beauty of her features made Hanuman imagine it might be Sita. He leaped up with joy. The next instant he cursed himself for his folly. \"Fie, fie,\" he said to himself, \"how foolish have I been! Could Sita sleep thus carelessly, covered with jewels, in a stranger\\'s chamber? The very thought is a sin.\" And he was overwhelmed with shame and sorrow at his error. Then he said to himself: \"Because she would not yield to him, this Rakshasa must have killed her.

On the way, not far from Mithila, they saw a beautiful ashrama which seemed untenanted. Rama asked Viswamitra: \"Whose is this ashrama with ancient trees? Why does such a beautiful abode stand deserted?\" Viswamitra replied: \"This ash rama is subject to a curse. Sage Gautama lived here with his wife Ahalya, spending his days in peace and holy meditation. One day during the sage\\'s absence from the ashrama, Indra, filled with unholy desire for the beautiful Ahalya, entered it disguised as Gautama and approached the lady with urgent solicitation. She was not deceived by the impersonation, but vain of her beauty and proud that it had won her the love of the lord of the celestials, she lost her judgment and yielded to his desire. When the sin had been sinned, realizing its heinousness and the fierce spiritual energy of her betrayed husband, she warned Indra of his terrible peril and begged him to be gone in the instant. Indra was fleeing in guilty panic; but unfortunately for him he almost bumped into the rishi who was just returning from his ablutions, clad in wet garments and radiating spiritual lustre. Pretense was hopeless before that all-seeing wisdom and Indra bowed in abject supplication, and threw himself on the mercy of the rishi. The sage looked at him with wrath and loathing and cursed him: \\'Lustful beast as you are, dead to all truth and righteousness, may your manhood fall away from you.\\' Indra at once became a eunuch and went back to the Devas in ignominious shame. Then the sage turned to his erring wife and prescribed a long penance for her. He said: \\'Living on air, you shall stay here, unseen by anyone. After a long time, Dasaratha\\'s son will pass this way. When he sets foot in this ashrama, you will be freed from the curse. Welcome him as a guest. You will then recover your lost virtue and get back your own beauty.\\' The sage then left his violated ashrama for Himalayas to engage himself in austerities there.\" Viswamitra said to Rama: \"Let us enter the ashrama. You will bring redemption to Ahalya and rekindle the light in her as the sage promised.\" And they went into the ashrama. As Rama set foot in the ashrama, the curse was lifted and Ahalya stood before them in all her beauty. Having lain concealed behind leaves and creepers and kept her vow for many years, she now shone, says the poet, in Rama\\'s presence, like the moon emerging from the clouds, like a flame issuing from smoke and like the sun\\'s reflection in rippling water. Rama and Lakshmana touched the feet of the sage\\'s wife made pure by penance. She welcomed the divine princes with all the customary rites of hospitality. A shower of flowers descended from the heavens as Ahalya, cleansed of sin, shone like a goddess. Simultaneously the sage Gautama returned to the ashrama and received his repentant and purified wife back to his affection. That is Ahalya\\'s story as told by Valmiki. There are in other Puranas and popular stories slightly varying versions, but the differences need not trouble us. Now, a word to those of our times who read Ramayana and Bharata and other Puranas. In these works, there are frequent references to Devas and Rakshasas. The latter were wicked, had no regard for dharma, and reveled in evil deeds. Asuras were also like Rakshasas.

Your visit has given me such great consolation and made me forget my grief for a while. When you leave, I shall sink again in my sea of sorrow. You came here crossing the great ocean. How will Rama and the big army cross it? Have you thought of that?\" Doubts assailed her once again. \"Have no doubt, my queen!\" said Hanuman. \"Do you think I am the only Vanara that could cross the sea? There is not a Vanara but has more power and skill than I. Not only Sugriva, but many in his army can fly round the world. What is this narrow sea to them? There are thousands among us who can roam in the sky. Have no doubt whatever. Do you think they would send the best among them as a mere messenger?

You have as good as crossed the ocean of sorrow and reached the other shore. God bless you.

May God bless you.\" And Hanuman left. Let us meditate with reverence on the heroic son of Anjana, the wise messenger who gave consolation to Sita and quenched her grief. 54. INVITING BATTLE AFTER taking leave of Sita, Hanuman sat for a while on the top of the garden wall and began to think: \"What can I do to put courage into Sita and some fear into Ravana and his friends to shake their arrogant confidence? It would be good to leave them some souvenir of my visit, some indication of what the future has in store for them. It is clear I must instill some fear into Ravana to prevent him from troubling Sita in the meantime. Fear is the only argument they understand. Ravana has untold wealth and one cannot part his friends from him. Hence sama (conciliation), dana (buying over) and bheda (sowing discord) are useless in this case. I should therefore do something terrible to frighten them, and warn them, not to ill-treat Sita. Yes, I must do this before I go away. At once he began to grow and assumed a huge form and began to lay waste the grove. Trees fell cracking to the ground, bowers collapsed, tanks and artificial hills were disfigured and destroyed. The beautiful Asoka Park soon became a mass of ruin from which the deer and the birds fled in fear. The slumbering Rakshasis woke up and were bewildered to see this unaccountable sight. Hanuman sat on the top of the wall of the garden, a huge figure of wrathful menace, waiting for the answer to his challenge.

In others songs celebrating the heroic exploits and glory of Ravana were being sung. Soldiers and scouts were everywhere. In the streets were people dedicated to particular religious practices and vows. There were others cruel in looks and ugly. The guards were armed with bows, swords, cudgels, slings, lances and other weapons. All the warriors were clad in armor. Some were handsome, some ugly, complexions varied from fair through brown to black. Some figures were very tall, others very short. Thus Hanuman saw that the population had been drawn from a wide area with varying climates and that the army had been recruited from the pick of many nations. He examined mansion after mansion. He saw women of exquisite beauty, some of them in the company of their husbands and others by themselves. He saw many young damsels, bright and beautiful like images of molten gold. Some were seated on the terraces, others were sleeping in their beds. Some were playing, others singing. Innumerable beautiful women he saw, but not Sita pining for Rama. The sight of so much beauty only filled Hanuman's heart with disappointment and sadness. He entered and examined the homes of many Rakshasas. There were war elephants, pure-bred horses, chariots and armories. Soldiers stood fully armed. After passing through many mansions and gardens filled with merriment and music, he came to a great palace rising aloft in a nobility of splendor far transcending all the magnificent buildings around. Looking at the elephants, horses and foot-soldiers in front, the high walls surrounding it and the beauty of its structure and the richness of its decorations, he concluded that this was Ravana's own palace, the central glory of splendid Lanka. He entered this palace. It was in every way a heaven on earth worthy of Ravana's peerless power and glory. The park, the birds sporting there, the shrines scattered here and there, filled Hanuman with wonder. He said to himself: 'What wealth, what beauty and what bliss!' He was for a while lost in amazement. But soon he recollected that he had not yet found Sita. Admiration gave place to concern over the yet unfulfilled purpose for which he had come. Passing through many mansions, he entered the innermost private apartment of Ravana and was almost overcome with the luxury and richness of its apartments which made it look a very abode of the gods. Everywhere was gold and silver, ivory and gems and pearls, and beautiful carpets and furniture and in their midst he saw the Pushpaka Vimana. It was a magic vehicle obtained from Brahma by Kubera. Vanquishing Kubera, Ravana brought it to Lanka as his booty. As from Vasishtha's cow, in the Pushpaka car one could get anything one desired. Ravana's chamber, which Hanuman now entered, was a very ocean of delight. Countless lovely women lay sleeping in the spacious chamber, some linked arm in arm and all in undress and the careless attitudes of sleep, making the place look like a garden of bright, flower-laden creepers. With his spirit controlled by dharma, Hanuman looked at all these sleeping women, each more beautiful than the other and all filled with joy and love, to see if any of them could be Sita.

Later, when Rama fights and is victorious in Lanka, Sita does not see it; she is a prisoner in the Asoka forest. She has to be content with listening to reports of the battle and of the prowess of her lord. But Jatayu\\'s devotion and heroism Sita saw with her own eyes in the Dandaka forest. Unarmed, he opposed the Rakshasa who had all his weapons and armor, and humbled his pride at the cost of his own life. Jatayu\\'s battle with Ravana is more important than the battles in Lanka. Hence the pious revere Jatayu along with Bharata and look upon him as an Alvar, a guide in the spiritual path. \"Lakshmana,\" said Rama, \"gather dry faggots. I shall churn the fire. We failed to perform our father\\'s obsequies, let us do it for the eagle -father who gave up his life for us.\" The princes chanted holy invocations as they poured libations to the departed spirit: \"O king of birds, may you enjoy all the bliss of the virtuous who perform great sacrifices! May you enjoy the bliss of Vanaprasthas who have performed great penance! May you enjoy the bliss of those who have made great gifts of land! May you enjoy the bliss of those who fight heroically in the field of battle! May the bliss of all good people be yours!\" After the ceremony Rama became steadier and stronger in mind. To millions of men, women and children in India, the Ramayana is not a mere tale. It has more truth and meaning than the events in one\\'s own life. Just as plants grow under the influence of sunlight, the people of India grow in mental strength and culture by absorbing the glowing inspiration of the Ramayana. When we see any helpless person in danger or difficulty, let us think of Jatayu and with firm mind try to help regardless of circumstance. Rama\\'s losing health and lamenting in sorrow may be compared to the behavior of another incarnation honored by another faith. It is said in the Bible that Jesus, nailed to the cross and about to give up his ghost, cried with a loud voice: \"Eloi! Eloi! lama sabachthani!\" which is Hebrew for \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" The mystery of incarnations is ever the same.

Cruelty and misery will grow apace and lay waste the land. For good to prosper and evil to be restrained, a king is essential. Thus Valmiki describes at length the dangers of anarchy through the mouths of leaders in that assembly. 'It looks as if a great darkness has enveloped the land,' they said. 'Dharma is in danger. Let us forthwith secure a king.' Vasishtha sent for tried messengers and said to them: 'Start at once. Go straight and swift to Kekaya. See that you wear no sign of sorrow on your face or show it in your behavior. Bharata should not know that the King is dead. Tell him simply that the family preceptor and ministers want his presence at once in Ayodhya and bring him along with you with all the speed you may. Tell him nothing about Rama and Sita going to the forest or the King's death on account of grief. To avoid all suspicion, take with you the usual gifts of jewels and precious garments for presentation to the King of Kekaya.' From this we can understand the meaning of what the Shastras and Kural say about Truth. Truthfulness should be such that it needlessly hurts no being in the world. The test for right conduct including truthfulness is harmlessness. This does not mean that truth is underrated. Soon the messengers were provisioned and equipped for the long journey and furnished with gifts of honor. Mounted on swift and sturdy horses, they sped past rivers and forests, uphill and down dale, and reached Kekaya, which was somewhere to the west of the modern Punjab, and found themselves in Rajagriha, its capital, where the Ikshvaku princes were residing in the palace of their maternal uncle. They decided to wait on the princes the next morning. The night the messengers arrived, Bharata had evil dreams and woke up in the morning filled with anxiety as to what they might portend. His face showed the state of his mind. His companions tried to entertain him with dance and mirth to make him forget his cares, but did not succeed. We still do not know all the secrets of nature and the telepathy of affection. Maybe Dasaratha's mental anguish and death throes reached Bharata across space and caused him his bad dreams. He said to himself: 'It seems to me that death is approaching my brother Rama or Lakshmana or myself. They say that an early morning dream does not fail to be fulfilled. And mine has been a terrible dream. I am full of fear. I know not what to do.' Just then the messengers were announced. The King of Kekaya and his son Yudhajit received the envoys with due courtesy. They paid their respects to the King and that princes, then turned to Bharata and said: 'The priests and ministers send you their blessings and request you to return at once to Ayodhya. They want us to convey to you that the need for your presence there is most urgent. Please touch for acceptance these garments and jewels to be given to your uncle and to the King as gifts from the palace of Ayodhya.' Bharata questioned the messengers after the welfare of all at home. The manner of his inquiry suggests that he had an uneasy premonition that his mother's headstrong and ambitious nature might have had something to do with this hasty summons home.

Afraid of saying \"No\" to what was more or less a command, all the rishis agreed to be present. But the sons of Vasishtha declined the invitation and made merry about a yaga at which the officiating priest was a once upon-a-time Kshatriya and the yajaman a stinking chandala. This reply, duly conveyed, enraged Viswamitra who exploded into a curse that Vasishtha\\'s sons do die and be reborn for seven generations in a tribe given to eating dog\\'s flesh. The sage then began the yaga. Extolling Trisanku\\'s eminent virtues, Viswamitra sought the help of the other rishis in effecting the bodily translation of Trisanku to heaven. Well aware of the sage\\'s mighty powers and fulminous temper, the invitees lent their support, and the yaga went on. It reached the stage when the gods were invoked to descend and accept the offerings. But no god came. It was clear that Viswamitra\\'s yaga was a failure. And the rishis, who had attended the ceremony, laughed within themselves at Viswamitra\\'s discomfiture. Wild with rage, Viswamitra held the ladle of ghee over the flames and said: \"O Trisanku, here behold my power. I now transfer for your benefit all the merit I have earned. If my austerities have any value, they should lift you to heaven in your physical frame. I care not if the Devas reject my offerings. King Trisanku! Ascend!\" A miracle followed. To the astonishment of those assembled, Trisanku in his chandala body rose heavenward. The world saw the power of Viswamitra\\'s tapas. Trisanku reached Swarga. But Indra forthwith pushed him down saying, \"Who are you, entering heaven with a chandala body? You fool that earned the curse of your preceptor, go down again.\" Trisanku fell from heaven, head downwards, screaming, \"Viswamitra! Save me!\" Viswamitra, seeing this, was beside himself with rage. Determined to teach the gods a lesson, he shouted to Trisanku. \"Stop there! Stop there!\" and, to the amazement of all, Trisanku\\'s earthward descent came to an abrupt stop and he stopped in mid air, shining like a star. Like a second Brahma, Viswamitra proceeded to create a new starry horizon to the south as well as a new Indra and new Devas. Alarmed at their supremacy, the Devas now came to terms and humbly entreated Viswamitra to desist. They said: \"Let Trisanku stay where he is at present. Let the other stars, of your creation shine forever, like your own fame and honor. Control your anger and be friends with us.\" Gratified at this submission, and as easily appeased as provoked, Viswamitra baited his creative process. But his stupendous activities had consumed the whole of the power that he had thus far acquired by his austerities, and he found he had to begin again. Viswamitra now proceeded westwards to Pushkara and resumed his austerities. For years the rigorous tapas continued, but once again as it was about to bear fruit something happened to rouse his anger and he lost his balance and cursed his own sons. Soon recovering himself, he firmly resolved never again to yield to anger, and resumed his tapas. After many years of austerities, Brahma and the Devas appeared before him and said: \"O Kausika!

As one reads or listens to this sacred story, one should form a mental image of Sita in her present state. One can imagine the agony of despair of any good woman who has by misfortune fallen into the power of a lustful man. What must be the state of Sita, daughter of Janaka and wife of Ramachandra, in such a predicament? To appreciate Valmiki\\'s metaphors and similes in this context, one should purify one\\'s heart and fire it with piety. One feels unequal to rendering into another language the beautiful similes by which Valmiki illustrates her condition. Only a few are cited here to give some idea of them. Ravana approached Sita still in the hope of obtaining her consent. Sita was covered with dust and had no jewels on her person but she shone as if wearing all the jewels that a princess must wear. She looked like a beautiful tree felled down and lying low. Her face was covered by light and shadow, like a lotus flower stained by mire. She swayed like a cobra bound by charms. Her state was like one surrounded by raging fires on four sides, like an army which had lost its chief warriors, like a river which had run dry, like a vessel for sacrificial fire that suffered desecration, like a lovely lotus tank destroyed by elephants, like a flowering creeper uprooted and cast aside, like a cow elephant separated from the leader of the herd, captured and tied as a prisoner. Sita sat trembling, overwhelmed with grief and fear. When she perceived Ravana\\'s approach, that very instant her heart travelled to Rama like a chariot drawn by swift steeds. With faded face and wasted form, she thought of her protectors far away. \"When will they come? Will they ever come?\" she asked herself and meditated on God. Ravana approached and spoke to her. Hidden in the branches of the tree, Hanuman watched what went on below. 50. RAVANA\\'S SOLICITATION TO SITA, plunged in a sea of sorrow and clinging to dharma and to the thought of her lord, Ravana spoke these words: \"O beautiful one! Why do you shrink from me? Do you not see how much I care for you? Though it is lawful for a Rakshasa to take another\\'s wife and possess her by force, I am a beggar for your love. There is no need to fear me. I shall never touch you till your heart turns towards me. Do not be afraid. My one wish is that you should care for me as I do for you. You must accept me with affection. Why do you make your body a prey to unavailing sorrow? O beautiful one! There is none like you in loveliness, none in all the world. It is not right for you to reject beautiful jewels, and clothes, to sleep on the ground and leave your hair unkempt. O gem among women, do not thus waste your youth and beauty. Now you have come under my protection, you should lack nothing. All pleasures are suitors for your selection. I cannot take my eyes away from your face bright like the full moon. Wherever on your body I set my eyes, there they remain fixed and immovable. Why should one with so much beauty suffer so much sorrow? Accept me and enjoy all the pleasures of the world. I will conquer the world and give it to Janaka for your sake. What will I not do for you? You will be my sovereign consort. All the queens and women in the palace will be ruled by you.

And so they rejoiced like lovers come together after separation. 10. PARASURAMA'S DISCOMFITURE Having thus safely handed back to Dasaratha at Mithila the princes entrusted to him in Ayodhya, and after attending the wedding celebrations, Viswamitra took leave of the two kings and went to Himalaya. In the story of Rama, Viswamitra has no further part. Viswamitra may be said to be the foundation of the grand temple of Rama's story. After Rama's wedding in Mithila, we do not see him again. It should be noted that characters that play a leading role in one canto of Valmiki almost fade out in subsequent cantos. Viswamitra who dominates the Bala Kanda does not appear again. Similarly, Kaikeyi and Guha are prominent only in Ayodhya Kanda. The same thing can be said of Bharata whom we do not come across in the chapters intervening between the Chitrakuta meeting and Rama's return to Ayodhya. The poet hardly brings Bharata before our eyes during the period of Rama's distress. The characters in Valmiki Ramayana (unlike those in the Mahabharata and in ordinary plays and novels) do not present themselves off and on. Critics should bear this general characteristic of Valmiki's epic in mind. King Dasaratha returned to Ayodhya, accompanied by his retinue. On the way, there were bad omens and anxious Dasaratha asked Vasishtha what they portended. Vasishtha replied that there was no need to be alarmed, for though the birds in the air indicated approaching trouble, the animals on the land promised a happy consummation. As Dasaratha and Vasishtha were thus conversing, there broke out a great storm. Trees were uprooted; the earth quaked and clouds of dust went up and hid the sun and there was an all-enveloping darkness. Everyone was terror-struck. Soon they knew the reason for the strange phenomenon. There stood before them the awe-inspiring figure Parasurama, the sworn enemy of Kshatriyas, with a bow on one shoulder and a battle-axe on the other, and with an arrow shining like lightning in his hand. Terrible in appearance, with his matted locks gathered overhead, he looked like Rudra exulting in the destruction of Tripura. His face emitted flame-like radiance. The son of Sage Jamadagni struck terror among Kshatriyas, many generations of which he had annihilated. Wherever he went he was preceded by storm and earthquake. And the Kshatriya race trembled in fear. The Brahmanas in Dasaratha's retinue said to one another: 'Because his father was killed by a king, Parasurama took a vow to destroy the Kshatriya race. We dared to hope that his vengeful wrath had been quenched in the blood of the innumerable kings he has slain. Has he again started his cruel campaign?' However, they honored him with the customary offering of water. After receiving it, Parasurama addressed himself to Rama: 'Son of Dasaratha, I have heard of your prowess.

When the Rakshasa king heard it, his eyes grew red with anger, and he ordered that Hanuman should be killed forthwith. But Vibhishana pointed out that it would be improper to kill a king\\'s envoy. \"According to the law of kings it is not permitted on any account to kill envoys and messengers. You can have him mutilated, whipped or branded, but not killed,\" so counselled Vibhishana. \"What is wrong,\"  asked Ravana, \"in killing one who has sinned so greatly?\" Answered Vibhishana with due politeness: \"No matter how grievous his offence, it was done at the bidding of others. To leave his royal masters alone and to slay their instrument, a mere messenger, what use or sense is there in it? Let us by all means seek ways of punishing those that sent him here. They must be brought here and given due punishment. If he is slain now, what chance is there of our real enemies being brought here? If, on the other hand, he is sent back alive to them, they will come here and attack us. Then they will receive proper punishment at your hands.\" Ravana agreed. \"Very well,\" he said, \"a monkey\\'s most cherished possession is his tail. Set fire to his tail, flog him soundly and turn him out.\" At these words of the Rakshasa king, his servants took Hanuman out. They wrapped his tail in rags of all kinds. His tail grew in size and, as it grew, they brought more and more old rags and wrapped them round. They soaked the whole in oil and set it ablaze like a huge flaming torch. Thus bound by ropes and with tail ablaze, Hanuman was taken through the streets of Lanka. \"Here goes the thief that entered our city!\" cried the women and children. They jeered at him as he was taken round by the exulting Rakshasas to the accompaniment of pipes and drums through all the highways and byways of Lanka. In the Asoka Vana the Rakshasis told Sita: \"The monkey with whom you had secret talk, do you know what has happened to him? They have wrapped his tail in cloth soaked in oil and have set fire to it. His tail is ablaze. They are taking him in procession through the town.\" They told Sita the tale and laughed in scorn. She kindled a fire and offered a prayer to the god of Fire: \"O Agni!

The sage Sarabhanga directed me here to receive your blessing and seek your instructions as to where I could build a home for the rest of my stay in the forest.\" The rishi\\'s face was bright with joy and he said meaningfully: \"You may live in this ashrama. There are many rishis living round about. The forest is full of fruit and roots. But evil beasts are abroad molesting the rishis and obstructing their penance. The sages are unable to bear this trouble. But for this, the place is good.\" The prince understood what the sage meant to convey. He bent and strung his bow and said: \" Holy sage! I shall destroy these evil-doers. My bow is strong and sharp are my arrows. It is not proper that we should dwell in this ashrama. It may interrupt your penance. We shall find a place for ourselves in the neighborhood. Permit us to do so.\" That night they stayed in the sage\\'s ashrama as his guests, The following morning, the three got up and bathed in the cool water fragrant with flowers, lit the sacrificial fire, performed their worship and touched the feet of the sage. \"By your grace, we spent a good night. We desire to see the other rishis in the region and receive their blessings. It is good to set out before the sun grows hot. Pray, give us leave to go.\" The sage embraced the princes and blessed them, saying: \"Visit the good rishis in the Dandaka forest.

He destroyed Khara and Dushana and their mighty army. Coming to hear of this, Ravana, bent on revenge, induced a Rakshasa to assume the form of a deer and beguile the princes in pursuit and, in their absence, carried off Sita by force. Grief-struck Rama went in search of Sita. He met Sugriva, the Vanara, and made friends with him. Rama slew Vali, the Vanara king, and secured to his brother Sugriva the Vanara kingdom. And Sugriva sent his Vanara warriors to all the quarters of the globe to find out where Sita was. These Vanara warriors, who could assume what shape they would, searched the whole world for the missing Sita. Following a clue given by Sampati, I crossed the sea a hundred yojanas broad, and have come here. And now I see one whose form, complexion and qualities are those described to me by Rama as his royal spouse\\'s. Having said this, Hanuman paused. These sweet words, uttered by someone from somewhere, filled Sita with wonder and delight. She looked around in all directions to discover who conveyed such sweet matter in so sweet a voice and in such exquisite language. She looked round, and up and down but found no human form to match this perfect speech. She only saw a lovely little monkey seated on the branch above her. Sita saw the son of Vayu, the wise minister of the Vanara king, in the form of a little monkey, radiant like the rising sun. The reader should imagine for himself the joy of Rama\\'s messenger, as Sita\\'s eyes fell on him. The reader who experiences this joy will find God in his heart. Narayana, who is waiting eagerly to enter and take possession of our hearts, would leave the great and boundless ocean of milk and come to dwell within us, when we cleanse ourselves of sinful thoughts. Seeing Hanuman, Sita said to herself: \"The words I heard the form I see, they cannot be real. I am only dreaming. One sees in one\\'s dream what one is constantly brooding over. How often has my mind dwelt on the story of my Lord! Is it any wonder then that I seem to hear the tale as told by someone? It is not real. It is only a dream. They say that if one sees a monkey in a dream, it forebodes evil to one\\'s kinsfolk. May God protect Rama from harm! May God keep all harm away from Lakshmana! May God bless all my kinsfolk in Mithila! No, no, this is no dream. My eyes are open and I see the same form still seated above me. There it is, clear and solid. No, this is no dream. And I am not asleep. How can one dream without sleeping? This is no dream. All this is real. Oh Gods! Could this indeed be a messenger from my dear Lord? Oh grant that it be so! Oh Vachaspati!

Sumantra accompanied Rama to Kaikeyi\\'s palace, treading the way with difficulty through the thorns. Rama entered the Queen\\'s apartment. As he stepped over the threshold, he started as if he had set his foot upon a snake, for he saw with awe-struck amazement his father lying on the bare floor in anguish. The King evidently had been struck down with some great sorrow. His face was like a parijata blossom wilted in the sun. He touched his father\\'s feet and paid the same filial worship to Kaikeyi. Dasaratha uttered in a low voice the name of Rama and stopped. He could speak no more. He could not look straight into the face of Rama. Rama was perplexed and filled with apprehension at the sight of his father, lying there unable to speak, in the grip of some great agony. What it could be Rama could not even guess. He turned to Kaikeyi and said: \"Mother, this is indeed strange. No matter how angry he was, my father would speak sweetly to me. Have I without knowing it offended him in any matter? Has some sudden sickness struck him down? Has someone spoken rudely to him? Do tell me what has happened. I can bear this suspense no longer.\" Bold Kaikeyi seized the chance and said: \"The King is angry with no one. There is nothing wrong with his health. But there is something in his mind which he is afraid to tell you. That is all. He is afraid to say it to you, lest you should feel hurt. That is why he is silent. Once upon a time, pleased with me he offered, and I accepted, the gift to two boons. Now, like an uncultured person, the King regrets he did so. Is this worthy of him? Is it not unbecoming of a King to pledge his word and then regret it? You have the power to fulfil his promise, but he fears even to tell you of it and is thinking of violating it. Would it be right? If you assure him that he need not be anxious about your attitude and that he should keep his word at all costs, you will give him the needed strength to behave righteously. You must give him the help he needs. The thing is in your hands. I shall tell you what it is, but after you promise me that you will help the King to fulfil his pledge.\" Rama, saddened at the thought that he should in any way be the occasion of distress to his father, said to Kaikeyi: \"Mother, am I indeed the cause of all this trouble? I do not deserve that you should have any doubts about me. If my father asks me to jump into the fire, I shall not hesitate to do it. If he asks me to drink poison, I shall drink it without hesitation. You know this. You know well enough that at his bidding I would drown myself in the sea. Here mother, I give you my solemn promise that I shall fulfil the King\\'s promise to you, and I never break my word.\" When Rama uttered these words, Kaikeyi exulted, for she knew she had conquered. The King for his part was in despair, seeing that all escape was now barred. Thereupon the pitiless Kaikeyi uttered these terrible words: \"Rama, your words are worthy of you. What higher duty has a son than helping fulfilment of the word his father has given? Now I shall let you know your father\\'s promise to me. When in the battle with Sambara your father was wounded, I rescued and revived him.

The King's pleas and reasons were like oil poured on the fire of his anger. 'This conduct is unworthy of your lineage', the sage said. 'Tell me if this is your final word. I shall go back the way I came. Long may you live with your kith and kin, having swerved from the path of Truth!' The earth quaked and the gods were afraid of the possible consequences of the sage's wrath. Vasishtha now turned to the King and spoke gently: 'It ill becomes you, King, to refuse having promised once. Born in the Ikshvaku line, you cannot do it. Having once said, 'I will do', you have no option but to do it. Failing, you will lose the merit of all your great gifts and deeds. Send Rama with the sage, and send Lakshmana too. You need have no fear for their safety, When they are protected by Viswamitra, no Rakshasa can hurt them. As the drink of the gods, shielded by the wheel of fire, so will Rama be by Viswamitra. You have no idea of Viswamitra's power; he is tapas in human form. Bravest of the brave and wisest of the wise, he is master of every weapon. In the three worlds there is not, and there will never be, any to equal him in martial or spiritual prowess. When he was king he obtained from the gods mastery of all weapons. He beholds the past, the present and the future. Then why does he want the princes, you may wonder. He can well take care himself of his yaga; but it is for the good of your sons that he has come here and appears to seek your help. Do not hesitate. Send your sons with him. Listening to the wise Vasishtha, Dasaratha saw things clearly and made up his mind to send Rama and Lakshmana. The two princes were then brought to the presence of the sage. The King, the Queen-Mothers and Vasishtha blessed them and sent them with Viswamitra. A pleasant breeze wafted and flowers were strewn by the denizens of the heavens. Auspicious sounds were heard. Bow in hand, the two lads strode proudly on either side of the Sage. Valmiki and Kamban revel in this picture of the two handsome princes marching out to their first adventure under the guardianship of a great rishi who had also been a renowned warrior a teacher who could create a new world; and beside him, head erect, two princely pupils born to end the Rakshasa race. With swords of victory hanging from their waists, bows and quivers mounted on strong shoulders, they moved, each like a three-headed cobra with uplifted hood. 5. RAMA SLAYA THE MONSTERS Viswamitra and the two princes spent the night on the bank of the river Sarayu. Before retiring Viswamitra initiated the princes in two secret mantras Bala and Atibala, which had the virtue of guarding them from fatigue and harm. They slept on the verdant bank that night and rising at dawn proceeded on their journey. They reached Kamashrama in Anga Desa. After presenting the princes to the rishis there, Viswamitra recounted to them the history of the ashrama. 'This,' he said, 'is the place where the Lord Siva was long engaged in austerities. It was here that the foolish god of love Manmatha aimed his arrow at Siva and was turned to ashes by his wrath. Hence this place is known as Kamashrama.' They were the guests of the rishis that night, and the following morning, after performing the usual rites, the sage and his pupils set out on their journey and\",\n",

These four months were like four ages to Rama, but to you, steeped in pleasures, they have perhaps sped like minutes! By delay you incur Rama's wrath and seek your destruction.' Go, Lakshmana, and tell him this. This was the angry and impatient message Rama wanted Lakshmana to take to Sugriva. Carrying this weight of his brother's grief and anger, Lakshmana was about to leave. Then Rama thought again. He knew Lakshmana's nature and feared danger from his rashness. So he called him back and said to him: 'In conveying my complaint to Sugriva, do not be harsh. Whatever his faults, he is our friend. Point out his faults to him, but say nothing harsh.' Lakshmana agreed, but he found it hard to control his own anger as he approached the gates of Kishkindha. Noting the severe face of Lakshmana who was fully armed, the Vanara sentry became alert and made ready to guard the fortress. This enraged Lakshmana still further. Some Vanaras ran to the inner apartments and reported to Sugriva: 'Lakshmana, furious with anger, is coming here bow in hand. We could not stop him.' But the Vanara king was tipsy and surrounded by women and he took no notice. The king's servants ordered the sentry at the gates to stand firm and prevent the entry of anyone. Lakshmana's anger became quite uncontrollable. Lakshmana forced his way in. There he met young Angada, the thought of whose youth and misfortunes took away something of the edge of his wrath. 'My child go and tell the Vanara king,' he said, 'that Lakshmana is waiting at the palace gate to have an audience of him on behalf of his grief-stricken brother.' Angada went accordingly to the king's apartment and informed him of Lakshmana's visit. But Sugriva was in no condition to understand. Angada saw this and took counsel with the ministers as to what should be done. Hanuman and some of the fellow ministers gently explained what was happening and Sugriva was at last roused from his tipsy condition. Sugriva said: 'I am not at fault, am I? Why should my friends Rama and Lakshmana be angry with me? Some enemy must have carried tales and set them up against me.' Hanuman answered: 'It is my duty, O king, to say these things and I say them. Do not be angry with me. We have delayed in carrying out our promise to Rama. We have forgotten Rama's grief. It is late, but not too late. Hence let us do quickly what we should. Let us seek forgiveness from Lakshmana. Let us, without further delay, take steps to fulfill our promise to Rama.' Then Sugriva agreed to receive Lakshmana. As Lakshmana went into the Vanara town, he marveled at its beauty and the culture of Kishkindha. Passing through beautiful streets, he stood outside the king's palace. Hearing the sounds of revelry, of dance and song, proceeding from within, he saw that the Vanaras had forgotten their promise and were lost in enjoyment. He could hardly control his anger. Still he held back from entering the women's chamber and, standing in a corner, outside, he twanged his bowstring.\",\n",

Get down from your car, and fight if you are not a coward as well as a thief! Ravana flared up in a rage. He attacked Jatayu. It was like a clash between a mighty wind and a massive rain -cloud. The battle raged in the sky above the forest. Jatayu fought like a winged mountain. Ravana aimed deadly darts at him. But the eagle intercepted them all and with his talons tore Ravana\\'s flesh. The enraged Rakshasa despatched sharp, serpent -like missiles against the bird. The bird -hero was desparately wounded, but fought on undauntedly while Sita watched the unequal combat with beating heart and tearful eyes. The sight of her made Jatayu all the fiercer in his attacks on Ravana. But his years were telling on him and he felt he must gather all his strength for a supreme attempt to conquer. Regardless of the wounds, he attacked Ravana fiercely and with his wings broke off and threw down his jewelled crown and deprived him of his bow. He attacked the chariot and killed the demon -faced mules and the charioteer and smashed the vehicle into a thous and pieces. Ravana fell on the ground, still clutching Sita. The elements rejoiced to see Ravana fall. The gallant old bird swooped down on Ravana\\'s back and tore great chunks of flesh off it, and tried to wrench off the arms which held Sita. But Ravana ha d twenty arms, and no sooner was one pulled off than another took its place and Sita was held in writhing helplessness. At last Ravana let go Sita and unsheathing his sword cut off the bird\\'s wings and talons. The old bird was now helpless and fell on the ground unable to move. Janaki ran and embraced Jatayu and cried: \"O my father! You have given away your life for my sake. You are a second father to my Lord! And now you are no more.

O Lakshmana, where are you? Won\\'t you, come to my rescue?\" The Rakshasa at last caught her and rose in the air. As the dark and massive Rav ana flew in the sky with her, Sita struggling in his grasp looked like a flash of lightning across a great black cloud. The Rakshasa carrying her appeared like a mountain covered by a forest -fire. The body of Ravana, lit up by Sita, coursed through the sky like a calamitous comet. Thus was Sita carried away by the Rakshasa. The sun grew dim and untimely darkness descended on the earth. All beings lamented: \"Dharma is destroyed. Righteousness has disappeared. Virtue and pity are no more. The dumb creatures of the earth, looking upwards, shed tears. Ravana, cruelly clutching the princess, flew as towards his ruin.

It is different in Valmiki, who includes Tara and the other women as part of the inheritance Sugriva won from Vali, in fact, as an appendage of the throne.

The bound of the mantra is undone when physical bonds are added. Hanuman is now held only by the ropes that he can burst asunder and the Brahmastra cannot be used a second time.\" Hanuman too understood this, and knew he could spring up free if he liked. But he welcomed the opportunity to meet and talk to Ravana and allowed himself to be dragged to the king, patiently bearing all their insults and cruelties in seeming helplessness. They belabored and foully abused him, and dragged him through the streets and women and children came out to look at him and jeer. 57. LANKA IN FLAMES His captors took him to the court of Ravana and placed him in front of the King. Forgetting the pain and insults he had borne, Hanuman gazed with wrathful curiosity at the giant monarch. As he gazed at him resplendent on his throne a sort of pitying admiration of the doomed Rakshasa entered his thoughts. Clad in silk of golden hue, with the royal crown on his head, the jewels inlaid in it shining brilliantly, Ravana sat there, a figure of dazzling splendor. The whole court was brilliant with shining gold and gems, pearls and silk. His dark body, lit up by the marks of royalty, looked like a great radiant hill. \"Alas!\" thought Hanuman full of anger, wonder and pity. \"If only this great one had not swerved from the path of dharma, not even Indra could equal him. What a form, what radiance, what strength! Trusting to the boon he had secured, he took to wicked ways and has lost his happiness and forfeited his greatness.\" As Hanuman was lost in thought thus, Ravana addressed his ministers: \"Find out from this wicked fellow who he is, where he has come from, who has sent him here and why he entered Lanka. Tell him to speak truthfully.\" As ordered by the king, Prahasta questioned Hanuman. \"Do not be afraid, monkey! If you speak the truth, you will escape punishment. Did Indra send you here? Or are you Kubera\\'s servant? Whose orders are you carrying out? Speak the truth and save yourself. Why have you come here thus disguised? Take care you hide nothing!\" Hanuman, facing Ravana directly, said: \"Neither Indra, nor Kubera has sent me here. I am a Vanara. I came here to have a look at the Rakshasa king. That was why I laid waste the garden. Otherwise I could not get to the king\\'s presence. And because they attacked me and tried to kill me, I killed them in self-defence. I have come here as the messenger of Sugriva, the Vanara king. O Rakshasa king my lord looks on you as a brother and sends you his greetings. Ramachandra, the famous son of king Dasaratha of Ayodhya, has become a friend of Sugriva and slaying Vali has made Sugriva king. When Ramachandra, heir to the throne of Ayodhya, was living in the Dandaka forest to fulfil his father\\'s word, his consort who had been left alone for a while was lost and at the behest of Rama and Lakshmana, Sugriva has sent his servant to look for her throughout the world.

It was not right for you to leave her and come away. It is now all over with Sita! Fatigued and thirsty with the futile chase, and now overwhelmed with anger and unbearable anxiety, Rama cried again: \"If I do not see Sita in the ashrama when we return, I shall surely die, Lakshmana. You will return to Ayodhya, the survivor of us three, and tell them what has happened. O, how will Kausalya bear her grief? Lakshmana, you have more than fulfilled Kaikeyi\\'s wishes. The Rakshasas will by now have visited on Sita, poor unprotected Sita, all their pent-up hatred against us. They must have killed and eaten her up by now. How could you leave her alone and come away? How could you be deceived by Maricha\\'s false cry? What shall I do now? I shall see Sita no more. The Rakshasas\\' plan has succeeded. My trust in you was misplaced and I shall never see Sita. How could you leave her and come away, how could you, Lakshmana?\" Lakshmana answered with tears in his eyes: \"What else, brother, could I do? When Sita heard the cry, \\'Alas Sita! Alas Lakshmana!\\' she was frightened. Quivering with fear she urged me to go to you at once and would tolerate no delay. She persisted, whatever I said to the contrary. I told her again and again not to be afraid and assured her that no foe was strong enough to do you harm, and that the cry of distress was not yours, but she would not listen. She charged me with having turned traitor to you and with having come to the forest with treasonable intentions. And, O brother, she found it possible in her anguish to say I would be glad of your death out of sinful intentions towards herself! I was half-dead with horror on hearing those words of hers and then she announced that she would kill herself if I did not go on the instant. Mad herself, she maddened me with her words of reproach and I ran towards you not knowing what else to do.\" But Rama was not satisfied. \"Whatever a foolish woman might have said in her fright, you should have stayed and not left her unprotected. How could you do such a foolish thing? You have brought calamity on me. I shall never see Sita again.\" The two hurried to the ashrama. Many bad omens appeared on their way. And Rama repeated, as he saw them one by one: \"I fear, I fear we shall never see Sita again!\" Reaching the ashrama, they found it, as they had feared, empty. Sita was not there. The deerskin, the kusa grass, the mat spread as a seat, all lay scattered on the ground. Rama wept and ran hither and thither in the grove round the cottage. The leaves and flowers on the trees had faded. Sita was nowhere to be seen. He wandered about like one mad. His eyes were bloodshot. He cried, \"Alas, have they eaten her up? Have they carried her away? O, how she must have trembled in terror! I cannot bear the thought of it. Could it be that she has gone to the river to fetch water? Could it be that she has gone out to cull flowers? Let us see.\" And he went searching among the trees, hoping that perhaps she was hiding and playing a practical joke on him.

My noble lord lived unafraid in the midst of the Rakshasas in the forest. Like a hero, he fought and killed the Rakshasas who encountered him. Like a thief, you stole me in his absence. But you cannot escape. Your fate impelled you to this sin because the hour of your ruin and the destruction of your race are near. You ask me to accept you. How foolish! Can the craw approach the swan? Can a heinous sinner be allowed near the sacrificial fire? I do not value life or body. Do you imagine I would wish to live despised by the world? Do not dream that out of fear or for saving my life I shall yield to you. Having spoken those words, she was silent. \"Is that so?\" said Ravana. \"Very well then, I shall give you twelve months\\' time. If you agree to accept me, well and good. If at the end of that period, you refuse, my cooks will make meat of your body for my breakfast. After warning Sita thus, he gave orders to the attendant Rakshasis: \"You should break her pride and obstinacy by some means or other. Put her alone in the Asoka garden and skillfully use fear and temptation to bring her to her senses. As we tame a wild she elephant, you should train her to submission.\" And angrily he went to his palace. The Rakshasis took Sita to the Asoka garden. It was a beautiful park attached to the women\\'s apartments. The trees were full of flowers and fruits, and beautiful birds played among them. Here, surrounded and guarded by terribly ugly Rakshasis, Sita was kept prisoner. Though overwhelmed by grief, she had the faith that Rama and Lakshmana would somehow discover where she was and rescue her, that her lord would destroy Ravana and take her back to a happy life with him. Sustained by this faith, she was neither frightened by threats nor deceived by temptations. Not for one day, or two, but for months, Sita suffered thus a close prisoner in the Asoka garden. The day was yet far off when the mighty Hanuman, crossing the sea, would visit Sita in her sorrow and bring her the message of hope and love and the assurance of relief: \"Rama loves you infinitely. He will be here soon. Be not afraid. All the women in our land who suffer sorrow in any way are so many replicas of Sita.

It would be terrible if Lakshmana is also deceived by this cry and leaves Sita alone to come to my succour. It looks as though the Rakshasas have planned this ruse to carry off Sita and eat her.

Jambavan, who was more dead than alive, moved slowly among the Vanaras, inquiring: \"Is Hanuman alive?\" \"Yes, I am here,\" said Hanuman, and bowed low before Jambavan. \"My son,\" said the old Vanara, \"proceed northwards at once across the sea to the Himalaya range. Between the Rishabha and Kailasa peaks, there is the Hill of Herbs. In that hilltop are four medicinal plants. If you bring them here quickly, Rama and Lakshmana and the Vanara army will recover consciousness. Their wounds will be healed and they will fight again. Do this without loss of time. Only you can do this.\" Accordingly, Hanuman sprang up into the air and moved fast. He reached the hill described by the venerable Jambavan and as he could not identify the plants, he carried the whole hill and returned with it to Lanka. Even with the approach of the Sanjivi hill, Rama and Lakshmana and the Vanaras felt the darts slip off their bodies. Their wounds healed and they became strong and stood up. The battle was resumed. Taking counsel with Rama, Sugriva now chose a few Vanaras and ordered them to enter Lanka and set fire to the city. Towards midnight they entered the city with torches. They attacked and overpowered the sentry and set fire to the palaces and turrets of Lanka. Houses in their thousands were reduced to ashes. The proud city was reduced to a mass of ruin. Valmiki describes this incident in detail. It reads very much like the destruction of cities in modern battles with which we are now familiar. Seeing Lanka being burnt down by the Vanaras, Ravana was furious and sent to the battlefield Kumbha and Nikumbha, the sons of Kumbhakarna, together with Yupaksha and other Rakshasa warriors. After another terrible battle, Kumbha was slain by Sugriva and Nikumbha by Hanuman. Makaraksha, son of Khara, who opposed Rama, fell to his fiery arrows. Many more mighty Rakshasas perished. Then, at the bidding of Ravana, Indrajit went once again to the battle. He rose into the sky and became invisible. Thus he fought again unseen by the Vanaras. Indrajit, by his necromancy, created a maya-Sita and, putting her in a chariot, took her before the Vanara army and seemingly killed her in their presence. Deceived and horrified by this, the Vanaras asked themselves: \"What good is it now to continue this war?\" They left the field and went to Rama with the heart-rending news. As a result of this trick, Indrajit gained time to perform an asuric sacrifice. Rama and Lakshmana, like the Vanara warriors, believed that Sita was dead and were lost in grief. They were completely bewildered and helpless when Vibhishana came and inquired what had happened. He listened to their story. Then he said: \"You have been deceived. Never would Ravana allow Sita to be killed. This is only a trick of sorcery. Indrajit tries to defeat you through magic. Having given up all hope of achieving success by normal means, he has gone to perform an asuric sacrifice of great power. If he completes it, we cannot vanquish him. We should therefore go and obstruct the sacrifice.

Hold yourself in patience for a moment and you will have his blood to drink.\" So saying, Khara rose. \"Do not go alone!\" she said. \"Take your army with you.\" Khara gave orders accordingly. A great army, fully armed, went in advance under the leadership of Dushana. Behind the army Khara proceeded majestically in a chariot. On the way he met with many bad omens which affected the spirits of his host. He laughed and reassured his army, saying: \"Never have I been so far defeated in battle. Do not mind these portents. We shall soon crush these two little men and return in triumph.\" The army took heart at these bold words of their leader. Hearing the tumultuous noise of the approaching army, Rama and Lakshmana prepared for battle. Rama told Lakshmana: \"Do you see the signs? It is certain that the Rakshasas of Janasthana are coming here to their death! I see in your face the glory of the victory that awaits us. Arm yourself and take Sita with you to a cave in the hill and look after her. I shall encounter the Rakshasa hordes and destroy them. Go at once. I do not require any help.\" Saying this, Rama put on his armor and strung his bow. Lakshmana did as Rama bade and took Sita to a mountain cave. A great battle was to follow. So the Devas and Gandharvas hovered in the heavens to watch the fight. They uttered benedictions and prayed for Rama\\'s victory. The rishis had misgivings. How was Rama, standing single, to meet and quell this huge army? As Rama stood there, bow in hand, the radiance of his face was like that of Rudra himself when he bent his great bow Pinaka. The Rakshasa force advanced in proud array, with drums and trumpets and the clanking pageantry of war filling the quarters with clamor and causing the denizens of the forest to stampede in all directions. Rama stood holding his bow with his hand on the string. Like great black clouds disturbing the sun the Rakshasa hordes surrounded him. The battle began. But while even the Devas wondered how he could withstand the yelling masses which rushed on him, a constant stream of deadly arrows sped from his bow before which the Rakshasa ranks withered and fell like moths before a blazing fire. Dushana himself now stood in front of Rama. Rama bent his bow and sent his shafts in all directions in an unceasing stream. Like rays from the sun, and with the speed of light, arrows shot out from the spot where Rama stood, spread out in all directions and brought down warriors, chariots, elephants and horses. The shafts pierced the bodies of the Rakshasas and came out, covered with their blood shining like fire. The army was utterly destroyed and Rama stood still, like Siva at the end of Time. Dushana came again with another great army. For a while he seemed indomitable. But soon Rama\\'s arrows laid low his chariot, drivers and horses. He jumped down and sprang towards Rama. Rama\\'s arrows, however, severed his arms from his trunk. And the monster fell dead on the ground like a huge elephant.

May I know who you are, who stands there, leaning on the tree trunk, face clouded with sorrow and eyes wet with tears? Are you a goddess or a Naga maiden? The radiance of your body makes me question whether you could be of merely terrestrial birth! Are you Rohini separated for a while from the Moon-god? Or are you Arundhati parted from sage Vasishtha? No, on closer observation, you seem to be a human woman, maybe a princess adorable in your distress. Please tell me who indeed you are. May God bless you! Are you the princess Sita carried off by Ravana from Janasthana? Is mine the bliss of seeing Sita, the beloved of Rama?' Sita was beside herself with joy. 'My child,' she said, 'indeed I am Sita, daughter of the king of Videha and Sri Ramachandra's spouse. For twelve years I enjoyed all happiness with him in Ayodhya. In the thirteenth year, King Dasaratha made preparations to crown my husband. Then Kaikeyi, his youngest wife, reminded him of boons he had granted long ago, and demanded that in redemption of his word he should crown her son Bharata king, and exile Rama to the forest. She threatened to kill herself if this was not done. Bound by promise the king had to yield to her insistence. At his bidding Rama relinquished the crown and betook himself to the forest not only without regret, but happy that it was given to him to enable his father to keep his plighted word. I refused to be left behind and insisted on going with my lord into the forest. Even before me, Lakshmana had put on bark-garments, determined to accompany his brother to the forest and serve him. The three of us entered the forest and were living in Dandaka. One day the evil-hearted Ravana carried me off by force. And he has kept me a prisoner here in this Asoka garden. Of the time limit of twelve months he has set for me, only two more months remain. When they are over I shall end my life.' Thus spoke the helpless princess in her sorrow. The speeches of Hanuman and of Janaki are sung by Valmiki in two brief chapters. As Hari appeared before the emperor Bali in the form of Vamana and measured the universe in two steps, so Valmiki has given the tale of Rama in a short recital by Hanuman and another by Sita.

As Vamana got the better of Bali and saved him from his ahankara, may this tale of Rama as told by Hanuman and Sita rid us of the sense of 'I' and 'my'. Sita concluded her story with the statement that two more months remained of the allotted twelve-month term and that her life would then end. To Sita overwhelmed by grief, Hanuman spoke words of comfort. 'O princess of Videha! Rama, the noblest of men and the mightiest of warriors has sent me to you with good news. His beloved brother Lakshmana, ever anxious for your welfare, sends through me his salutations to you.' 'Ah! What happiness is mine!' she exclaimed.

I shall walk in front of you in the forest ways and tread the thorns and the hard ground to make them smooth for your feet. Do not think me obstinate. My father and mother have instructed me in dharma.  What you tell me is totally opposed to what they have taught me. To go with you wherever you go, that is my only course.

Rama explained to Sita that life in the forest was not as easy as she thought and set out at great length the difficulties and dangers and again insisted that she should not think of accompanying him. Sita\\'s eyes filled with tears. \"Tigers, lions, bears, snakes none of them will come near me. They will flee from us at the sight of you.

It was settled that Sita should accompany Rama to the forest. She sent for the poor and gave away all her belongings and prepared herself for life in the forest. Lakshmana also decided to go with his brother and be of service to him in the forest, and Rama  had to agree. The three went to take leave of the aged King.

Are not human beings well known to be weaklings? Why are you afraid of this wretched man driven into the forest by his father? And he relies on the support of monkeys and bears! Of such a man you are afraid. Really I am ashamed of you. Or could it be that you cannot bear to see me happy? Why do you talk like this to me? I cannot bend before Rama. If it is wrong policy or wrong ethics, I cannot help it. You may take it that it is part of my nature and I cannot change it.

Having said this, he went to his high tower and himself surveyed the enemy\\'s strength. His ministers and officers were with him. Those who had gone out to reconnoitre described at length the Vanara chiefs and the army behind them. They recounted the strength of that huge army of bears and monkeys gathered together from the far-flung forests, mountains and river-valleys of the world. They spoke of their physical strength and courage, their firm devotion to Rama, their unity and eagerness to slay the Rakshasas. All those that had gone confirmed this. \"Look!\" one of them said. \"That majestic and graceful youth with matted locks and bow in hand is Rama. See how he looks round him with eyes of love and command and how his glances seem to brighten the quarters and to fill all with devotion and confidence.

As the ministers extolled the strength of the enemy, Ravana\\'s rage grew more and more furious. This is the way of a tyrant. The wise king is never angry with those who b ring him true information or with ministers who give him good advice for his welfare. But now Ravana\\'s mind was confused. He had no use for true facts or good advice. His thought followed a strange line. He judged Rama by his own character. He thought that, if Sita could be made somehow to yield to him, Rama would return home disgraced and broken hearted. Hence be resolved to make one last attempt with a different technique. He sought the help of a Rakshasa sorcerer. \"Oh, Lightning -Tongue!\" he said (that w as his name), \"prepare a head which looks so exactly like Rama\\'s that it will deceive Rama\\'s nearest and dearest into believing it is his. When I send for you, come to the park where Sita is incarcerated and place it before her. The sorcerer agreed to do as he was bidden.

The conjurer came and placed before Sita a head that looked exactly like Rama\\'s. Startled by the sight, Sita cried, \"So then, is this my fate?\" and broke into hopeless lamentation. Meanwhile, Rama\\'s army had come close to Lanka and the ministe rs and generals sent word to Ravana desiring an immediate interview.

Rama too was glad to see that Sugriva had returned safe. Observing bleeding wounds on his body, he said: \"Sugriva! I am filled with wonder and joy at this, your valorous exploit. But what you did was not right. It is not for a king to rush into risks. How could you suddenly and without consulting anyone take such a dangerous course?\" Sugriva confessed his fault. \"True, it was improper to rush into battle without consulting you.

The kingdom of Lanka now belongs to Vibhishana. He is worthy to rule and protect his people. If you are not willing to surrender and seek safety, then have your obsequies performed in advance.

I am the son of Vali whom you no doubt remember. I have come as Rama\\'s messenger. The time for your liberation from sin has come. You may, if you choose, die in battle and attain the swarga of brave men, cleansed of your foul sins. But if life is dear to you, you may beg it of Rama after humble surrender, and he never refuses mercy to a suppliant. If what I have heard about you is true, you will elect to fight, which means you choose to die.

Look your last on lovely Lanka!\" Ravana\\'s rage flared up like a flame. \"Seize him, kill him, the villain!\" he shouted. At once, two Rakshasas caught hold of Angada.

I can slay the gods, the Vanaras, the Gandharvas and the Yakshas. My darts can burn up Indra himself and Yama too. Wait and see how this wretched fellow Rama and his army will be destroyed.

He explained to them that it was the sound of the Sarayu flowing into the Gangs. The princes paid silent homage to the confluence of the two holy rivers. A river or a hill, a tree or a cloud, indeed any object of beauty may raise one to contemplation of the Supreme Being and silent worship of Him. In particular, sacred rivers, temples or images, which have for generations been the objects of devotion and worship, possess this power in a special degree, in virtue of the sacred thoughts they have witnessed and absorbed as garments retain perfumes. Having crossed the Ganga, Viswamitra and the princes made their difficult way through a dense forest made dreadful by the reverberating roar of wild beasts. \"This,\" Viswamit ra said, \"is the Dandaka forest. What is now a terrible forest was once a well -peopled country. Once upon a time, Indra was contaminated by sin, having killed Vritra, and had therefore to exile himself from the world of the Devas. The Devas set to themselves the task of cleansing Indra. They brought waters from the sacred rivers and bathed him to the accompaniment of mantras. The waters which cleansed Indra flowed into the ground and enriched the earth and the land became tremendously fertile.\" All dead things, rotting corpse or stinking garbage, when returned to the earth are transformed into things of beauty such as fruits and flowers and the wholesome things that nourish life. Such is the alchemy of Mother Earth. Viswamitra continued: \"For long people lived here happily till Tataka (wife of Sunda, a Yaksha) and her son Maricha wrought havoc and changed this into the dreadful wilderness it now is. They are still in this forest. And none dare enter it for fear of Tataka. She is equal in strength to a score of elephants. I have brought you here to rid the forest of this great enemy. There is no doubt that this monster, who is a source of trouble to the rishis, will be destroyed by you.\" Rama, who listened to this, asked the sage: \"You say she is a Yaksha. I have never heard that Yakshas are particularly strong. What is more, how does a woman happen to possess so much strength?\" Viswamitra replied: \"You are asking a very pertinent question. Her strength comes from a boon granted by Brahma. There lived a Yaksha by name Suketu. Having no progeny he performed tapas and won a boon from Brahma thus: \\'You will have a beautiful daughter of great strength of body, but you will have no son.\\' Suketu\\'s daughter, Tataka, beautiful and strong, was married to Sunda, a Yaksha, and their child is Maricha. Sunda at one time incurred Sage Agastya\\'s curse and died. Provoked by this, Tataka and Maricha pounced on Agastya who cursed them to be monsters living on the carcases of men. So Tataka is now an ugly monster. Thenceforward, she and Maricha have been harassing the dwellers in this region of Agastya. Do not hesitate to destroy her on the ground that it is against Kshatriya dharma to kill a woman. Her atrocities are intolerable. To punish the wicked, whether male or female, is the duty of kings. It is right to kill her, as to kill a wild animal for the sake of human safety. This is a duty cast on rulers. Many women have been punished with death for their crimes. Hence do not hesitate.\" Rama said to Viswamitra: \"Our father\\'s behest is that we should obey you without question. Bidden by you and for the general welfare, we shall kill Tataka.\"',\n",

I have come now to do my utmost and persuade Rama to go back with me to Ayodhya, and there to be crowned King. And it is my purpose to be his humble slave all my life. I have come here to ask you where Rama dwells, to go and beg of him to return home. And me, you suspect!\" Bharadwaja said: \"Bharata, I know your real nature. You are a scion of the race of Raghu. I questioned you because I wished to draw out a revelation of your affection and loyalty and thereby establish and spread your glory. Do not grieve. The Prince is dwelling on Chitrakuta hill. Stay here today. Tomorrow, you and your ministers shall go there. You will please me by accepting hospitality for a day in the ashrama.\" Bharata said: \"My Lord, your wishes and words of affection are a feast. What more is required?\" Bharadwaja smilled because he could see that Bharata was unwilling to cast the burden of feeding an army on a poor ascetic. He said: \"I am bound to entertain you in a manner worthy of your status and goodness. Why have you left behind your army and retinue?\" Bharata answered: \"I followed the rule that one should not approach a rishi\\'s dwelling with a retinue. There is a big crowd following me. It would be a great disturbance to you if they all come here.\" The rishi said: \"Nothing of the sort. Order them all to come up.\" And so Bharata ordered. Bharadwaja went to the sacrificial fire and, uttering mantras, sipped water thrice and called on Viswakarma, Maya, Yama, Varuna, Kubera, Agni and other celestial beings and ordered them to produce a great feast for Bharata and his followers. Then a miracle happened. The feast that was ready in Bharadwaja\\'s ashrama was like that which Vasishtha gave of old to Viswamitra. The only difference was that here, there was no quarrel or commotion. Everyone had ample accommodation. Sandal paste, flowers, food and drink, music and dance by divine performers were all provided. Bharadwaja\\'s feast was more sumptuous than that given by emulous kings to one another. Dwellings, vehicles, servants rose suddenly into being. The guests forgot themselves in the feast. The soldiers in Bharata\\'s army in the ecstasy of present enjoyment exclaimed to one another: \"We shall not go to the Dandaka forest. We shall not return to Ayodhya. We shall stay here forever.\" How were they to know that the good things they enjoyed were for a day, and would disappear at dawn, like the stage and the crowd after a village play is over? The guests ate fully and soon fell fast asleep. The following morning Bharadwaja said to Bharata: \"At a distance of two-and-a-half yojanas from here runs the river Mandakini. On its banks is an unpeopled forest with Chitrakuta hill to its south. On the slope of the hill, in a hut your brothers and Sita are dwelling.\" And he explained in detail the way they should follow. The three queens were presented to receive the sage\\'s blessings. \"This is Queen Kausalya,\" said Bharata, \"the mother of Rama and here, to her right and supporting her, stands the mother of Lakshmana and Satrughna, sorrow-stricken and limp like a creeper stricken by summer winds.\" \"And here is my mother, the cause of all our sorrow,\" said Bharata, pointing to Kaikeyi who along',\n",

Who is the happy father of such sons?\" Viswamitra told Janaka that they were the sons of King Dasaratha. He narrated how they had protected his own yaga and destroyed the Rakshasas. \"They have come here,\" the sage went on, \"to see, if they may, the great bow of Rudra in your palace.\" Janaka understood the meaning of Viswamitra\\'s words and rejoiced. The King said: \"The prince is welcome to see the bow. If he can string it, he will win the hand of my daughter. Many were the princes who saw this bow and went back, unable even to move it. I shall indeed be happy if this prince succeeds where so many have failed and I am thereby enabled to give Sita to him.\" Janaka then ordered his men to bring the bow which was kept safe and sacred in an iron box. It was brought on an eight-wheeled carriage and dragged like a temple chariot during a festival. \"Here,\" said Janaka, \"is Rudra\\'s bow worshipped by me and my ancestors. Let Rama see this bow.\" After obtaining permission from Viswamitra and the King, Rama stepped out to the iron bow-case, while all eyes were fixed on him in wishful expectation. Opening the box, he lifted the bow effortlessly, as if it were a garland of flowers, and resting one end of it against his toe, he bent and strung it and drew the string back with such irresistible force that the mighty bow snapped with a crash like a clap of thunder. And there fell from heaven a shower of flowers. Janaka proclaimed: \"My beloved daughter shall be wedded to this prince.\" Viswamitra said to Janaka: \"Send your swiftest messengers to Ayodhya to give the news to Dasaratha and invite him.\" Janaka\\'s messengers reached Ayodhya in three days. They met King Dasaratha who was seated, like Indra, on his throne and said to him: \"Sage Viswamitra and King Janaka have sent you happy news. Your son who came to Mithila has won our princess Sita by fulfilling the condition set for her hand. He not only strung Rudra\\'s bow which none before could so much as lift, but bent its tough pride till it broke. King Janaka eagerly awaits your gracious consent for the marriage, and your presence and blessing at the festivities. May it please you to start for Mithila with your retinue.\" Dasaratha, who had sent Rama with Viswamitra with a heart not altogether free from anxiety even after the sage\\'s assurance, was thrilled with joy on hearing this good news. He told his ministers to prepare for the journey and left the very next day for Janaka\\'s capital. Dasaratha and his following reached Mithila and were received with enthusiastic welcome. Exchange of courtesies over, Janaka said to Dasaratha: \"My yaga will soon be over. I think it best to have the marriage as soon as the yaga is over,\" and sought his approval. Dasaratha replied: \"You are the bride\\'s father and it is for you to order things as you wish.\" At the appointed day and hour, giving away the bride, King Janaka said to Rama: \"Here is my daughter, Sita, who will ever tread with you the path of dharma.

But how does it fit on this occasion? Can any of you say that for life in the forest I have no capacity but only Bharata has? Then the wise Vasishtha found a solution for the problem in which righteousness struggled with righteousness as to which should be more right. \"O, Bharata, rule the kingdom under Rama\\'s autho rity and as his deputy. No blame would attach to you then and the pledge would be kept.\" Rama took Bharata on his lap and told him, \"Brother, look on the kingdom as my gift to you.

And for fourteen years I shall stay outside the city and discharge the King\\'s duties in your place, paying reverent homage to your sandals. At the end of that period, you will return and accept the kingship.\" \"So be it,\" answered Rama. He placed his feet on the sandals and handed them to Bhara ta who prostrated himself on the ground and accepted them and put them on his head. Bharata and his retinue turned back towards Ayodhya.

The city, bereft of the King and Rama, appeared desolate to Bharata. It seemed to be enveloped in the darkness of a moonless night. When he returned in haste from Kekaya , he had entered the city in fatigue and shapeless fear and suspense; but today he entered it again fully realising all the tragedy. He remembered the past and thought of the present and grieved afresh. He went to the palace and took the queens to their desolate apartments. He went to the assembly hall, and said: \"Great is my sorrow. But I shall bear it. I shall stay in Nandigrama and carry out my tasks as I have promised Rama. Make all arrangements for this purpose.\" This was done and he solemnly announced  in the assembly, \"This kingdom is Rama\\'s. For the time being, he has asked me to be in charge.

Sugriva forgot the privations of his exile and the remorse for his brother\\'s death. He enjoyed to the full his present prosperity and even Tara reconciled and adapted herself to altered circumstances in the interests of her son. The royal palace of Kishkindha was full of joy and drinking, and the gloomy months of rain, which the Raghu brothers spent in leaden repining, sped with golden-winged enjoyment for Sugriva and his household. Only Hanuman felt anxious. He could not forget Rama\\'s business. He was looking out for an opportunity to remind the king of his pledge to Rama. At last, the rains ceased and the sky was cleared of cloud and lightning. The air was sweet with the perfumes of flowers and the songs of birds and joy came to life in the forest again. The intelligent and high virtuous Hanuman now approached his king. Sugriva had entrusted all official duties to the ministers and was absorbed in pleasure. Hanuman knew that the wisest and best of men neglect their promises in such circumstances and addressed the king with great politeness: \"You have regained the kingdom of your ancestors and are in secure possession and enjoyment of it. But something yet remains to be done. You must fulfil your promise to your allies and so increase your fame and strengthen your power. Even at the sacrifice of one\\'s own interests and pleasure, one should carry out the business of one\\'s friends according to one\\'s promise. Only so can a king\\'s authority and reputation grow. It will be best to fulfil one\\'s promise before the due date. In any case delay should be avoided. Fulfilment after the promised date is worse than useless. One should not wait to be reminded by one\\'s friends of what had been promised to them. All this you know without my telling you. Remembering what Rama had done for us. We must take steps to fulfil our promise without waiting to be reminded by him. The rainy season is over. There is no ground for further delay. We can no longer postpone the task of searching for Sita. Rama may be very patient, but that does not justify any further delay on our part. Did not Rama kill your foe promptly, not minding the danger or the blame involved? We should fulfil our promise with equal promptness.\" Thus politely did Maruti convey his advice to Sugriva. The latter accepted it and, thanking Hanuman, ordered Nila to mobilise the Vanara army. \"All the world must be searched and Sita found,\" he said. \"Order therefore the most powerful Vanaras to come and join up at once. Those who fail will be summarily punished.\" Having said this, Sugriva went back into private apartments. Rama and Lakshmana spent the time in their cave waiting for the end of the rainy season and the fulfilment by Sugriva of his promise. But when the rains were over and the forest and its creatures shone with renewed beauty, Rama grieved intensely at the thought of Sita suffering at the hands of the Rakshasas. \"The world is full of life and joy,\" said Rama. \"But Sita is in agony somewhere. And I sit still here, awaiting the favor of this ungrateful Vanara king. Alas, she walked cheerfully through the Dandaka forest, as if it were a palace-park. She did not mind the stony ground and the thorns in the path. What must be her suffering now?

And so we are here. We seek the friendship of your king. Hanuman answered: 'Sugriva too has been persecuted by Vali and deprived of his kingdom and his wife. It is now certain that he will regain both. My king will gain much by your friendship and with his help you will also succeed in your efforts.' Then the three went to Sugriva. The way was such that only a Vanara could traverse it. Hanuman resumed his natural shape and carried both the princes on his back. The hearts of good men meet and instantly come together. As the Kural says, the spontaneous mutual attraction of two hearts and not long acquaintance creates friendship a nd this friendship was part of the divine dispensation. It was predestined that Hanuman's sublime devotion should be at Rama's service for the fulfilment of the purpose of the incarnation. And so there was acceptance at first sight. His carrying the two pr inces on his shoulder was an outward symbol of inward union. As friends and lovers embrace each other, Hanuman, the loving servant, rejoiced in carrying his Lord on his shoulders. Ascending the Malaya hill, Hanuman went in advance to Sugriva and, announcin g the visit of Rama and Lakshmana, said: 'Rama is a prince full of wisdom and virtue. He is the eldest son of the famous Emperor Dasaratha. To fulfil his father's promise, he left Ayodhya with his brother and wife and came to the forest. King Dasaratha was compelled by his younger wife, in fulfilment of an undefined promise given long ago, to banish Rama. In the forest, taking advantage of the princes' absence, Ravana carried away the wife of Rama. Rama has come here, seeking your help in finding her. The princes are worthy of your friendship. You too will gain greatly from friend ship with such heroes.' Sugriva assumed the form of a handsome man and had a long and heart - to - heart talk with the princes. Stretching forth his hand to Rama, he said: 'Princes, if you care for the friendship of a Vanara, here is my hand, accept it. Hanuman has told me all about your virtue and greatness.' Rama clasped his hand and embraced him. Soon Hanuman got together some faggots and kindled a fire. Circumambulating the flames R ama and Sugriva swore mutual friendship: 'Let us share our joys and sorrows.' They vowed: 'Let our friendship be eternal.' They cut down the branch of a tree and sitting on it, Rama and Sugriva were engaged in cheerful talk and so, too, were Hanuman and La kshmana seated on another. Sugriva narrated the story of his life. How greatly he and his elder brother, the mighty Vali, were once devoted to one another, and how malignant fate had through no fault of Sugriva's made deadly enemies of them.

Brahma knew that he had granted to Ravana the boon prayed for by him that he should be invulnerable and invincible against Devas, Asuras, Gandharvas and other such beings. In his arrogance, Ravana did not care to ask for security against mankind. As Brahma revealed this fateful omission all the Gods rejoiced and turned to Vishnu. Absolutely surrendering themselves to Hari, the Devas begged him to be born as a man and put an end to Ravana and his atrocities. Hari agreed and assured the Devas that he would be born as four sons of King Dasaratha who was then performing a sacrifice for progeny. As the ghee was poured into the fire and the flames shot up to meet it, from out of the flames came a majestic figure, resplendent like the noonday sun, holding a bowl of gold. Calling King Dasaratha by his name, the figure said : \"The Devas are pleased with you and are answering your prayer. Here is payasam sent by the gods for your wives. You will be blessed with sons if they drink this divine beverage.\" With joy unbounded, Dasaratha received the bowl as he would receive a child  and distributed the payasam to his three wives, Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi. He asked Kausalya to drink a half of the payasam and he gave a half of what remained to Sumitra. Half of what was then lift was drunk by Kaikeyi, and what remained was given to  Sumitra again. Dasaratha\\'s wives were happy, even as a beggar suddenly coming upon buried treasure. And in due course all of them were expectant mothers. 2. SAGE VISWAMITRA In course of time, Dasaratha\\'s sons were born Rama of Kausalya and Bharata of Kai keyi. Sumitra gave birth to twins, Lakshmana and Satrughna. She had drunk the divine payasam twice. In proportion to the quantity of payasam drunk by the respective mothers, the sons are traditionally considered to be parts of Vishnu. Rama was thus half - Vishnu. But such calculations have no meaning, as it is impossible to measure the Infinite arithmetically. Sruit tells us that even a fraction of the Supreme Being is whole and complete by itself. \"Om Poornamadah Poornamidam Poornat Poornamudachyate Poornasy a Poornamadaya Poornamevavasishyate.\" \"What is whole, this is whole; what has come out of the whole is also whole. When the whole is taken out of the whole, the whole still remains whole.\" Dasaratha\\'s four sons were given all the training prescribed for princes. Rama and Lakshmana were specially devoted to each other and so were Bharata and Satrughna. We can imagine that this special attachment arose out of the way the divine payasam was divided among the King\\'s wives. Dasaratha was happy to see his four sons grow up strong, virtuous, brave and lovable and with all other princely qualities. One day as the King was contemplating his sons\\' matrimony, ushers rushed in to announce that the great Sage Viswamitra had arrived to see him. Viswamitra was held in awe by all as the most powerful among rishis. Viswamitra\\'s arrival at Ayodhya was unexpected; and King Dasaratha stepped down from his throne and advanced a few paces respectfully to receive the sage.

Dear child, take the horse and complete the yaga. If these ashes are to be watered according to custom so that the souls of the princes m ay rest in peace, Ganga should be brought down here from the land of the Devas.\" Amsuman rushed home with the horse and told the king all that he had found and learnt. Sagara was immersed in sorrow at the fate that had overtaken his sons. However, the hors e having been brought back, he completed the yaga.

This meeting of Bharata and Guha and the way they shared their sorrow is an episode dear to the Vaishnava Alvars and other true Bhaktas. Bharat questioned: What food did Rama take when he was here? Where did he sit? Where did he sleep? What did he say? And what did he do? Guha answered every question lovingly and pointed the spot where Rama had slept. And when he was asked, Where did Lakshmana sleep? He replied: Lakshmana said, 'When Rama and Sita lie stretched on the bare earth, how can I sleep?' and he shed tears and, like me, stood on guard the whole night, bow in hand. As Bharata pictured this scene, his grief became unendurable. He saw the spot where Rama and Sita had slept that night and showed it to the weeping queens. Asked what Rama ate, Guha answered: My Lord, they fasted that night.\",\n",

Why, dear friend, do you feel such grief? After Rama, Bharata will reign for a hundred years. Do not cry. You know how affectionate Rama is to me. Indeed he cares for me more than for his own mother. Does not Rama hold his brothers as dear as life? It is not right that you should fear any harm from Rama. Alas, Alas! said Manthara. Why are you so foolish? Once Rama is crowned king, what chance has Bharata? Do you not know the rule of succession? When Rama ascends the throne all prospects of royalty for Bharata and his line are at an end. After Rama, Rama's son will be king, and after him that son's son will be king, and so the succession will go on. Eldest son succeeds eldest son. There is no chance for a younger brother, no matter how good or manly he is. My dear, you know not even this. What is one to do? Once Rama is crowned, she continued, he will not leave Bharata alone. There will be danger to Bharata's life. If you want Bharata to live, advise him to remain away, an exile from home; for if he returns he will be coming to his death. It would be safest for him to leave even his uncle's house, and hide his head in obscurity in some more distant land. And Kausalya is no friend of yours. She bears you a grudge because you are the King's favorite and have often slighted her. And now she is sure to wreak vengeance on you. You know the wrath of a rival wife is a raging fire when it finds its chance. You may take it that, if Rama is king, Bharata is as good as dead. Therefore, think hard. Be firm. Decide something and stick to it. Somehow Bharata must be crowned. Rama must be banished from the kingdom. Fear now entered the heart of the Queen. Manthara won. Kaikeyi's face was flushed; her breath became hot. Helpless she clung to Manthara for comfort and safety. Because his first two wives had borne no children, Dasaratha, following the royal custom, married Kaikeyi. At that time Kaikeyi's father secured from Dasaratha the promise that the child of her womb should become king after him. In such a promise given by a childless king there was nothing surprising and nothing wrong. At that time, his then queens had long been childless. The King took a third wife for the sake of progeny. Even then his wish for a son to be born was not fulfilled. Many years passed. After the great sacrifice was performed, all three wives bore children. The son of the Queen Eminent, Rama, was the eldest among four sons. He was also great in virtue, fully equal to the burden of Kingship, acceptable to ministers, citizens and vassal princes. How could Dasaratha violate the royal custom and ignoring Rama's claim anoint Bharata? Moreover, neither Bharata nor Kaikeyi had ever thought of or wished for the fulfilment of this old and forgotten promise. During all the intervening years, no word had been spoken on this subject. Hence the King thought there could be no difficulty in installing Rama as Yuvaraja in accordance with the custom of the dynasty and public expectation. And there was no cloud in Kaikeyi's mind. This is clear from Kaikeyi's behavior. And Bharata was too noble to raise this question. And, yet, as Dasaratha told Rama, even the purest of minds is mutable. When fate conspires with bad counsel, any one of us might be corrupted. And this happened to Kaikeyi. The gods in Heaven had received\",\n",

Your star is setting. Foolish girl, is this the time to sleep?\" Kaikeyi, fearing that some calamity had overtaken Manthara, asked her gently: \"What is troubling you? Why are you thus upset?\" And the clever Manthara began: \"Destruction has come upon both you and me, my girl. Dasaratha has decided to make Rama Yuvaraja, the real ruler of this land. What greater cause for sorrow need I have? When grief comes to you, how can I remain unconcerned? I have come running to you. You were born and bred in a royal family. You were married into a royal family. Now, alas, all is over. Like the simple woman you are, you have been deceived. Your husband has cheated you with sweet words. It is a deep plot, as anyone can see. He put Bharata out of the way by sending him to the distant place of his uncle, and is taking advantage of his absence by hurriedly crowning Rama. By tomorrow it will all be over. And you watch all this, lying in bed and doing nothing, while you and all who depend on you are being destroyed.\" And so, Manthara went on talking. Kaikeyi\\'s ears heard the words without quite heeding their drift. Like the rest of the royal household her mind was overwhelmed now with the joyous expectation of Rama\\'s coronation, for she loved and esteemed Rama like everybody else. \"Manthara, you have brought me good news,\" she said. \"Is my son Rama to be crowned tomorrow? What greater joy can come to me? Here, take this. Ask me for anything else.\" So saying, Kaikeyi took the necklace off her neck and gave it to Manthara. It was a royal custom at once to reward with a rich gift the bringer of any important good news. Kaikeyi thought Manthara, like any other officious personal attendant, was ingratiatingly jealous in her mistress\\'s interests. How could this woman understand the goodness of Rama, or affairs of State? And so she thought her foolish fears would be banished if she saw that her mistress was happy at the event. Kaikeyi\\'s mind was still uncorrupted. She had the culture of her noble lineage and was not easily amenable to low thoughts. This but increased Manthara\\'s grief. She flung away the necklace and said: \"Woe to you, stupid woman. All is lost and stupidly you laugh with joy. How can you be blind to the misfortune that is coming to you? Am I to laugh or cry at this folly? Your rival, Rama\\'s mother, has conspired to making him King. And you jump with joy. Insane woman! What would be Bharata\\'s state when Rama reigns? Would not Rama fear and ever look upon Bharata as a dangerous enemy? Rama knows human nature. He knows that Bharata alive would be a constant threat to his power and therefore must be killed. Does not one kill a cobra out of fear? Hereafter there is no security for Bharata\\'s life. Tomorrow morning Kausalya will be a happy woman and you will bend before her as a well-dressed slave. You will stand before her, hands clasped in obedience. From tomorrow your son too will be a subject and a slave. In these apartments there will be no more honor or joy.\" And she stopped, unable for grief to continue. Kaikeyi heard all this and wondered \"Why should Manthara have such fears? Does she not know Rama? Is he not dharma embodied in human form?\" She said: \"Manthara, have you not known and rejoiced in Rama\\'s',\n",

Else you would by now be dead. A brother, I see, is one\\'s worst enemy. All the world knows that the envy of brothers brings dishonor and discomfiture to the brave. They hide their real desire and wait for their time and, when it comes, do not hesitate to practise their treachery. How true is the complaint of the wild elephants in the story! We are not afraid of the burning fire. \\'We do not mind the hunters and their long spears. The noosed ropes and the chains can do little harm to us. But the elephants which join the hunters and give us trouble, these brothers and cousins who turn against us, they are our terror!\\' Yes. So long as one is safe and prosperous, the brother smiles and talks pleasantly. But when danger comes, he is ready to leave. The bee does not stay with the flower after the honey has been sucked. It goes in search of another flower. Brothers and cousins are no better than these bees. One cannot trust them in adversity. If any one else should have spoken as you have done, Vibhishana, I would have slain him here and now. Base fellow! You are a disgrace to our race!\" Unable to bear the insult, Vibhishana rose and said: \"My brother, you may speak as you please. Though you have wandered from the way of dharma, you are still my brother and I warn you that, drawn by the noose of Yama, you are going along the path of destruction. My advice, salutary but unpleasant, you reject. It is easy to speak sweet words. Your ministers are doing it. I spoke for your good. But truth is bitter and you hate it. The terrible vision of Rama\\'s darts destroying you is before my mind\\'s eye and makes me speak as I do. You call me your enemy. Defend your city and your life as well as you can. God bless you!

Four good Rakshasa friends went along with him. 64. THE VANARA\\'S DOUBT HAVING committed a sin and run into danger, Ravana did not see how to extricate himself. Like other kings in a quandary, he called a council for consultation. Many spoke flattering words. Only two spoke harshly. One said: \"You have committed a fault. But I will give up my life for you.\" This was Kumbhakarna. The other, Vibhishana, said: \"You have committed a sin, but there is still time for repentance and escape from consequences. If you take this right and wise course, we shall all escape destruction and live happily.

So there I lay protected.\" The hordes that went north, east and west returned in a month and reported that Sita was not to be found anywhere. \"Carefully we searched forests, mountains, rivers and cities, but nowhere could we find her. Hanuman, who had gone southwards, is the lucky one. Did not the Rakshasa carrying Sita also travel southwards? And Hanuman has not yet returned.\" Rama, hearing this, was satisfied that the Vanaras had done their best. Hanuman and Angada entered and searched the caves and forests of the Vindhyas. Then they came upon a desert, where a rishi was performing tapas. By his curse it was devoid of trees and plants, of birds and beasts. Travelling further south, they saw a big Asura. The cruel one, regarding the Vanara crowd as a good meal sprang up to catch them. They thought at first that this was no other than Ravana. Angada rushed towards him and gave him a mighty blow. Unable to stand it, the Asura spat blood and fell on the earth and lay dead like a great hill. Rejoicing in the thought that Ravana was dead, the Vanaras searched the forest for Sita. But, there was no sign of her. And so they carried the search elsewhere. Often they would weary of their fruitless search and sit down in blank despair. At such times, Angada, Gandhamadana or some other leader would encourage them and make them resume the search. Many days were spent in this way. Yet Sita was not to be seen and they dreaded Sugriva\\'s displeasure. Very far they travelled southwards in their search. Passing through a desert, fainting with hunger and thirst, they saw a cave from which issued a variety of birds full of the joy of life. The gentle breeze which came out of it covered them with the pollen of lotus flowers and filled them with fragrance. The Vanaras concluded: \"undoubtedly there was water where the birds and perfume came from.\" And the Vanaras forming a chain with linked hands plunged cautiously into the dense darkness of the cave with hearts full of hope, though too parched with thirst even to shout. At long last, all of a sudden, light appeared and they saw a lovely grove with streams of pellucid water and trees bowing under their wealth of fruit. Then they came to a city, with streets paved with jewels set in gold and great palaces beautiful as a dream. They went along and then they saw an aged tapasvini clad in the garments of a recluse and seated on a dark skin. The Vanaras trembled before the divine splendor of her face. Hanuman took courage to approach her. Bowing low before her, he said: \"Salutations to you, Mother. May we know who you are? Thirsty and tired, we entered the dark cave hoping for some water. And now that we see this unpeopled golden city with trees and tanks, we are afraid, lest this be a vain vision arising from the madness of too great sufferings. Explain all this to us and remove our fears.\" She answered: \" How did you find your way into this cave? You will have plenty of fruits and drink here.

When he regained consciousness, he loudly reviled Kaikeyi, but she only smiled scornfully. She surely was not responsible for Sita going to the forest. The princess sought her own pleasure by going to the forest with her h usband and would not be dissuaded. Lowering his eyes as he was leaving, Rama said: \"Father, I leave behind my mother Kausalya, blameless and tender - hearted lady, bereft of her son in her old age. This sudden fate is bitter to her as death, but she consents to live only for your sake, to share your sorrow and console you. She is incapable of harboring an unkind thought towards anyone, and she has never before felt the pang of such poignant parting. Be kind to her when I am no longer here and, when I return a fter my long exile in the hope of putting my head on her feet, let me not hear that she has died of sorrow.\" Thus Rama spoke, unable to bear the thought of his mother\\'s grief. As Rama went out speaking thus, Dasaratha could not endure the sight and covered his face with his hands. 18. TO THE FOREST AFTER Rama left his father\\'s presence with these words, the stricken King lay prostrated in speechless sorrow, and it was some time before he could muster his faculties sufficiently even to think. When he recover ed some strength, he muttered half unconsciously: \"Surely I must in a previous birth have inflicted hideous suffering to loving hearts. I must have torn calves from their mothers, children from their parents, husbands from their wives. How else could I suf fer thus? And death does not come when we want it.

They were natural in one who had been deceived by the Rakshasa. He thought for a while and realized that the only approach to her confidence was to awaken hope and joy in her sorely tired heart by extolling Rama and harping on the certainty of her rescue and his victory.

The courtiers address him; his answers surprise by their pertinency and depth. At length he is brought to the king. The stranger’s conversation here is not less remarkable, as they sail along the beautiful shore; but after a while he addresses King Olaf thus: Yes, King Olaf, it is all beautiful, with the sun shining on it there; green, fruitful, a right fair home for you; and many a sore day had Thor, many a wild fight with the mountain giants, before he could make it so.

He who would bring out Gothic art (and but little of it has hitherto been brought out) must himself be a poet, and what a mine of wealth there is open to him! Would that genuine art fever would attack our artists and that some of the treasures that lie hidden in the granite quarries of the Norse mythology might speedily be exhumed! In his work, entitled Science of Beauty, Dr. John Bascom has taken decided grounds against nude figures in art. We would recommend the eighth chapter of that work to the careful consideration of the reader. We are not able for want of space to give his opinion in full, but make the following brief extract: There is one direction in which art has indulged itself in a most marked violation of propriety, and that too on the side of vice. I refer to the frequent nudity of its figures. This is a point upon which artists have been pretty unanimous, and disposed to treat the opinions of others with hauteur and disdain, as arising at best from a virtue more itching and sensitive than wise, from instincts more physical than aesthetical. This practice has been more abused in painting than in sculpture, both as less needed, and hence less justifiable, and as ever tending to become more loose and lustful in the double symbols of color and form, than when confined to the pure, stern use of the latter in stone or metal. Despite alleged necessities, despite the high-toned claims and undisguised contempt of artists, our convictions are strongly against the practice, as alike injurious to taste and morals. Indeed, if injurious to morals, it cannot be otherwise than injurious to taste, since art has no more dangerous enemy than a lascivious, perverted fancy. Nay, in the radiant dawn of our Gothic history our poets and artists may, if they would but look for them, find chaste themes to which they may consecrate the whole ardor of their souls for the aesthetical elevation and ennoblement of our race.

Any single myth may have become more prominent, may have become more perfectly developed by one branch of the race than by another; one branch of the great Teutonic family may have become more attached to a certain myth than another, while the myth itself would remain identical everywhere. Local myths, that is, myths produced by the contemplation of the visible workings of external nature, are colored by the atmosphere of the people and country where they are fostered. The god Frey received special attention by the Asa worshipers in Sweden, but the Norse and Danish Frey are still in reality the same god. Thunder produces not the same effect upon the people among the towering and precipitous mountains of Norway and the level plains of Denmark, but the Thor of Norway and of Denmark are still the same god; although in Norway he is tall as a mountain, his beard is bristly, and he rushes upon his heroic deeds with the strength and frenzy of a berserk, while in Denmark he wanders along the sea-shore, a youth, with golden locks and downy beard. It is the Asa-mythology, as it was conceived and cherished by the Norsemen of Norway and Iceland, which the Old Norse literature properly presents to us, and hence the myths will in this volume be presented in their Norse dress, and hence its name, Norse Mythology. From what has already been said, there is no reason to doubt that the Swedes and Danes professed in the main the same faith, followed the same religious customs, and had the same religious institutions; and upon this supposition other English writers upon this subject, as for instance Benjamin Thorpe, have entitled their books Scandinavian Mythology.

They may be said to belong to the fairy mythology of these countries. We give a brief sketch of these objects of popular belief, chiefly from the excellent work of Thomas Keightley. A general knowledge of them is necessary in order to appreciate the rich folk-lore literature of Norseland. The elves still retain their distinction into white and black. The white or good elves dwell in the air, dance in the grass, or sit in the leaves of trees; the black or evil elves are regarded as an underground people, who frequently inflict sickness or injury on mankind, for which there is a particular kind of doctors and doctresses in most parts of Scandinavia. The elves are believed to have their kings, and to celebrate their weddings and banquets, just the same as the dwellers above ground. There is an interesting intermediate class of them called in popular tradition hill-people (hauga folk), who are believed to dwell in caves and small hills. When they show themselves they have a handsome human form. The common people seem to connect with them a deep feeling of melancholy, as if bewailing a half-quenched hope of salvation. Their sweet singing may occasionally be heard on summer nights out of their hills, when one stands still and listens, or, as it is expressed in the ballads, lays his ear to the elf-hill; but no one must be so cruel as by the slightest word to destroy their hopes of salvation, for then the spritely music will be turned into weeping and lamentation. The Norsemen usually call the elves hulder or huldrefolk, and their music huldreslaat. It is in the minor key, and of a dull and mournful sound.',\n",

Dividing the three periods in Greek history more definitely, we will find that imagination and poetry predominated during the whole time before Solon; emotion, activity and history during the time between Solon and Alexander the Great; and then reflection and philosophy, such as they were, from Alexander to the collapse of the Greek states. Even among the Romans, the most prosaic of all peoples, that nation of subduers, enslavers and robbers, traces of this growth from poetic childhood through historic manhood to philosophic old age can be found, which proves moreover that this is a law of human development that cannot be eradicated, although it may be perverted.

This was a digression, and we confess that it is not the first one we have made; but in the world of thought, as in the world of music, monotony is tedious; and the reader having perhaps refreshed his mind by the interlude, we will proceed to discuss further the union of the ethical with the physical interpretation of mythology. Physical interpretation alone is the shell without the kernel. Nature gives us only the source of the myth; but we want its value in the minds and hearts of a people in their childhood. The touching gracefulness of Nanna, and of Idun reclining on Brage’s breast, was not suggested by nature alone, but the pictures of these reflect corresponding natures in our ancestors. To explain a myth simply by the phenomenon in external nature (be it remembered, however, that man also constitutes a part of nature) that suggested it to the ancients, would be reducing mythology to a natural science; and it is sad to witness how the beautiful and poetical Eddas, in the hands of some, have dwindled down into the dry chemistry, chronology, electro-magnetism, mathematics, astronomy, or, if you please, the almanacs, of our forefathers, instead of being presented as the grand, prophetic drama which foreshadowed the heroic and enterprising destiny of the Teutonic nations. The twelve dwellings of the gods, they say, represent the twelve signs of the zodiac; Balder they make the constellation of the lion; Odin’s twelve names, they say, are the twelve months of the year; his fifty-two names, which he himself enumerates in Grimnismal, are the fifty-two weeks in the year; the thirteen valkyries are the thirteen new moons in the year.

Arngrim Jonsson tells us that when Thorkel Maane had arrived at the age of maturity and reflection, he disdained a blind obedience to traditionary custom, and employed much of his time in weighing the established tenets of his countrymen by the standard of reason. He divested his mind of all prejudice; he pondered on the sublimity of nature, and guided himself by maxims founded on truth and reason. By these means he soon discovered not only the fallacy of that faith which governed his countrymen, but became a convert to the existence of a supreme power more mighty than Thor or Odin. In his maker he acknowledged his God, and to him alone directed his homage from a conviction that none other was worthy to be honored and worshiped. On perceiving the approach of death, this pious and sensible man requested to be conveyed into the open air, in order that, as he said, he might in his last moments contemplate the glories of Almighty God, who has created the heavens and the earth and all that is in them. Harald Fairfax (Haarfager), the first sovereign of Norway, the king that united Norway under his scepter in the year 872, is another remarkable example in this respect. He was accustomed to assist at the public offerings made by his people in honor of their gods. As no better or more pure religion was known in those days, he acted with prudence in not betraying either contempt or disregard for the prevailing worship of the country, lest his subjects, stimulated by such example, might become indifferent, not only to their sacred, but',\n",

But Skrymer awoke and asked whether there had fallen a leaf down upon his head, and whether they had eaten their supper and were ready to go to sleep? Thor answered that they were just going to Sleep, and went to lie down under another oak, but also here it was dangerous to sleep. At midnight Thor again heard how fast Skrymer Slept and snored, so outrageously that a thundering noise was heard through the whole woods. Arising he went over to the giant, swung his hammer with all his might, and struck him right in the skull, and the hammer entered the head clear to the handle. Skrymer, suddenly awakening, said: What is the matter now? Did an acorn fall down upon my head? How is it with you, Thor? Thor went hastily away and said that he had just waked up; it was midnight, he said, and time to sleep. Then thought that if he could get an opportunity to give the giant a third blow he should never see the light of day anymore, and he now lay watching to see whether Skrymer was fast asleep again. Shortly before day-break he heard that the giant was Sleeping again. He got up, hastened over to him, swung his hammer with all his might, and gave him such a blow on the temples that the head of the hammer was buried in the giant’s head.

The elves of light dwell in Alfheim (home of the elves), but the elves of darkness live under the earth, and differ from the others still more in their actions than in their appearance. The elves of light are fairer than the sun, but the elves of darkness blacker than pitch.

Even among Christians, and, if we give the subject a careful examination, even among those who confess one and the same faith and are members of one and the same church, we find that the religion of one man is never perfectly like that of another. They may use the same prayers, learn and subscribe to the same confession, hear the same preacher and take part in the same ceremonies, but still the prayer, faith and worship of the one will differ from the prayer, faith and worship of the other. Two persons are never precisely alike, and everyone will interpret the words which he hears and the ceremonies in which he takes part according to the depth and breadth of his mind and heart—according to the extent and kind of his knowledge and experience, and according to other personal peculiarities and characteristics. Even this is not all. Every person changes his religious views as he grows older, as his knowledge and experience increase, so that the faith of the youth is not that of the child, nor does the man with silvery locks approach the altar with precisely the same faith as when he knelt there as a youth.

Ygdrasil is the tree of life in the garden of Eden; Askahd Embla, the first human pair, are Adam and Eve; the blood of the slain giant Ymer, in which the whole race of frost-giants was drowned, (excepting one pair, who were saved, and from whom a new giant race descended,) is the flood of Noah, the deluge; the citadel called Midgard is the tower of Babel; in the death of Balder, by Hoder, who was instigated by Loke, they find the crucifixion of Christ by Judas, instigated by the devil, etc.; displaying a vast amount of erudition, profoundness and ingenuity, that might have been applied to some good purpose. We refrain from giving more of the results of their learned and erudite investigations, from fear of seducing ourselves or our readers into the adoption of their absurdities. Others scholars (Snorre Sturleson, Saxo Grammaticus, Suhm, Rask, and others,) give us what is called an historical interpretation, asserting that Odin, Thor, Balder, and the other deities that figure in the Norse mythology, are veritable ancestors of the Norsemen, men and women who have lived in the remote past; and as distance lends enchantment to the view, so the ordinary kings and priests of pro-historic times have been magnified into gods. Odin and the other divinities are in Snorre Sturleson's Heimskringla represented as having come to Norseland from the great Svithiod, a country lying between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. According to the historical interpretation the mythical worlds are real countries that can be pointed out on the map. This was the prevailing view taken during the last two centuries.\",\n",

The dying hero knows that the valkyries have been sent after him to invite him home to Odin's hall, and he receives their message with joy and gladness. That the brave were to be taken after death to Valhal was one of the fundamental points, if not the soul, of the Norse religion. The Norsemen felt in their hearts that it was absolutely necessary to be brave. Odin would not care for them, but despise and thrust them away from him if they were not brave. And is there not some truth in this doctrine? Is it not still a preeminent duty to be brave? Is it not the first duty of man to subdue fear? What can we accomplish until we have got rid of fear? A man is a slave, a coward, his very thoughts are false until he has got fear under his feet. Thus we find that the Odinic doctrine, if we disentangle the real kernel and essence of it, is true even in our times. A man must be valiant—he must march forward and acquit himself like a man. How much of a man he is will be determined in most cases by the completeness of his victory over fear. Their views of Odin, Valhal, and the valkyries made the Norsemen think it a shame and misery not to die in battle; and if natural death seemed to be coming on, they would cut wounds in their flesh, that Odin might receive them as warriors slain. Old kings, about to die, had their bodies laid in a ship; the ship was sent forth with sails set, and a slow fire burning it, so that once out at sea it might blaze up in flame, and in such manner bury worthily the hero both in the sky and in the ocean. The Norse viking fought with an indomitable, rugged energy. He stood in the prow of his ship, silent, with closed lips, defying the wild ocean with its monsters, and all men and See Thomas Carlyle's Heroes and Hero-worship.\",\n",

At other times she comes as a beautiful maiden, chilled and shivering with the cold of the night, to the fires the fishermen have kindled, hoping by this means to entice them to her love. Her appearance prognosticates both storm and ill success in their fishing. People that are drowned, and whose bodies are not found, are believed to be taken into the dwellings of the mermaids.

In the Norse mythology, on the other hand, the centralizing idea or thought is its peculiar feature' in it lies its strength and beauty. In the Norse mythology, the one myth and the one divinity is inextricably in communion with the other; and thus, also, the idea of unity, centralization, is a prominent feature, and one of the chief characteristics of the Teutonic nations. While the Greek mythology foreshadowed all the petty states of Greece, as well as those of South Europe and South America, the Norse mythology foreshadowed the political and social destinies of united Scandinavia, united Great Britain, united Germany, and the United States of North America. When the Greeks unite, they fall. We Northerners live only to be united. As we would be led to suppose, from a study of the physical and climatical peculiarities of Greece and Norseland, we find that the Greek mythology forms an epic poem, and that the Norse is a tragedy. Not only the mythology, considered as a whole, but even the character of its speech, and of its very words and phrases, must necessarily be suggested and modified by the external features of the country. Thus in Greece, where the sun’s rays never scorch, and where the northern winds never pierce, we naturally find in the speech of the people, brilliancy rather than gloom, life rather than decay, and constant renovation rather than prolonged lethargy. But in the frozen-bound regions of the North, where the long arms of the glaciers clutch the valleys in their cold embrace, and the death-portending avalanches cut their way down the mountain-sides,\",\n",

The Elder Edda presents the Norse cosmogony, the doctrines of the Odinic mythology, and the lives and doings of the gods. It contains also a cycle of poems on the demi-gods and mythic heroes and heroines of the same period. It gives us as complete a view of the mythological world of the North as Homer and Hesiod do of that of Greece. But (to use in part the language of the Howitts) it presents this to us not as Homer does, worked up into one great poem, but as the rhapsodists of Greece presented to Homer’s hands the materials for that great poem in the various hymns and ballads of the fall of Troy, which they sung all over Greece.

Thor wears a red beard, his nature is fire, he is girded with the belt of strength, swings a hammer in his hand, rides in a chariot drawn by two goats, from whose hoofs and teeth sparks of fire flash, and the scarlet cloud reflects his fiery eyes, over his head he wears a crown of stars, under his feet rests the earth, and it shows the footprints of his mighty steps. He is called Asathor and also Akethor (from aka, to) and is the strongest of gods and men. He is enormously strong and terrible when angry, but, as is so frequently the case with very strong men, his great strength is coupled with a thoroughly inoffensive good nature. His realm is named Thrudvang and his mansion Bilskirner, in which are five hundred and forty halls. It is the largest house ever built. Thus the Elder Edda, in the lay of Grimner: Five hundred halls And forty more Methinks has Bowed Bilskirner; This is the usual explanation based on the Younger Edda. More recent investigations show that he was called Oku-thor, a corruption of Ukko-Thor. Ukko is of Finnish origin, and is the name of the thunder-god of the Tshudic tribes. See Kalevala, the Finnish epic. (298)\",\n",

Fjalar asked her whether it would not be some consolation to her to look out upon the water, where her husband had perished; and when she consented to this, Fjalar said to his brother Galar that he should get up above the door, and, as she passed out through it, he should let fall a mill-stone upon her head, for he was sick and disgusted with her crying. The brother did so, and thus she perished also. A son of Gilling, a giant by name Suttung, avenged these treacherous deeds. He took the dwarfs out to sea and placed them on a shoal, which was flooded at high water. In this critical position they implored Suttung to spare their lives, and accept the verse-inspiring beverage, which they possessed, as an atonement for their having killed his parents. Suttung, having agreed to these conditions, released the dwarfs, and, carrying themead homewith him, committed it to the care of his daughter Gunlad. Hence poetry is indifferently called Kvaser’s blood, Suttung’s mead, the dwarfs’ ransom, etc. How did the gods get possession of this valuable mead of Suttung? Odin being fully determined to acquire it, set out for Jotunheim, and after journeying for some time he came to a meadow, in which nine thralls were mowing. Entering into conversation with them, Odin offered to whet their scythes, an offer which they gladly accepted. He took a Whetstone from his belt and whetted their scythes, and finding that it had given their scythes an extraordinarily keen edge the thralls asked him whether he was willing to dispose of it; but Odin threw the Whetstone up into the air, and as all the thralls attempted to catch it as it fell, each brought his scythe to bear on the neck of one of his comrades, so that they were all killed in the scramble. Odin took up his night’s lodging at the house of Suttung’s brother',\n",

And the Norsemen have an old literature, which the scholar must of necessity be familiar with in order to comprehend the history of the middle ages. When we have thus done justice to our own Teutonic race we may turn our attention to the ancient peoples around the Mediterranean Sea, the most important of which in literary and historical respects are the Hebrews, Greeks and Romans. The antiquities of these peoples will always form important departments in our colleges and universities, and It is our duty to study them; but they Should not, as they still to a great extent do, constitute the all-absorbing subject of our attention, the summa summarum, the foundation and superstructure of our education and culture. It has been argued by some that the Latin is more terse than English; but did the reader ever reflect that it takes about sixty syllables in Latin to express all that we can say in English with forty syllables? The large number of inflectional endings have also been lauded as a point of superior excellence in the Latin; but as a language grows and makes progress, it gradually emancipates itself from the thraldom of inflection and contents itself with the abstract, Spiritual chain that links the words together into sentences; and did the reader ever run across this significant truth, expressed by George P.

He wore a variegated Cloak, was bare-footed, his breeches were of linen, and a wide-brimmed hat hung down over his face. He was very tall, looked old, and was one-eyed. He had a sword in his hand. The man went to the tree, struck his sword into it with so powerful a blow that it sunk into it even to the hilt. No one dared greet this man. Then said he: He who draws this sword out of the trunk of the tree shall have it as a gift from me, and shall find it true that he never wielded a better sword. Then went the old man out of the hall again, and no one knew who he was or whither he went. Now all tried to draw the sword out, but it would not move, before Volsung’s son, Sigmund, came; for him it seemed to be quite loose. Farther on in the Saga Sigmund had become king, and had already grown old when he waged war with King Lynge. Then orns protected him so that he could not be wounded. In a battle with Lynge there came a man to Sigmund, wearing a large hat and blue cloak. He had but one eye, and had a spear in his hand. The man swung his spear against Sigmund. Sigmund’s sword broke in two, luck had left him, and he fell. The same Saga afterwards tells us that Sigmund’s son, Sigurd, sailed against the sons of Hunding, on a large dragon. A storm arose, but Sigurd commanded that the sails should not be taken down, even though the wind should split them, but rather be hoisted higher. As they passed a rocky point, a man cried to the ship and asked who was the commander of the ships and men. They answered that it was Sigurd Sigmundson, the bravest of all young men.

The Roman Empire had arrived at its highest point of power, and saw all the then known world subject to its laws, when an unforeseen event raised up enemies against it from the very bosom of the forests of Scythia and on the banks of the Tanais. Mithridates by flying had drawn Pompey after him into those deserts. The king Of Pontus sought there for refuge and new means of vengeance. He hoped to arm against the ambition of Rome all the barbarous nations, his neighbors, whose liberty she threatened. He succeeded in this at first, but all those peoples, ill united as allies, poorly armed as soldiers, and still worse disciplined, were forced to yield to the genius of Pompey. Odin is said to have been of this number. He was obliged to flee from the vengeance of the Romans and to seek, in countries unknown to his enemies, that safety which he could no longer find in his own.

We have now made an acquaintance with the lives and exploits of the good and propitious divinities, with the asas and vans. But what of the evil? Whence come they, and how have they been developed? Many a philosopher has puzzled his brain with this vexed question, and the wisest minds are still engaged in deep meditations in regard to it. It is and will remain an unsolved problem. But what did the old Goths, and particularly our Norse forefathers, think about the development of evil? What forms did it assume among them? How did it spring forth in nature, and how did it impress the minds and hearts of the people? These are questions now to be answered. There are in the Norse mythology two individuals by the name of Loke. The one is Utgard-Loke, hideous in his whole being, and his character was sketched in the myth about Thor and Skrymer.

Loke his variegated stream of fire within the earth; the one proclaiming mercies and blessings, the other destruction; both perish in Ragnarok. Hel and her pale host also betake themselves to the final contest, but the Eddas say nothing about their taking part in the fight. How can they? They are nothing but emptiness, the mere vanity of the heart, in which there is no substance; they are but the darkness which enwraps the earth, and are not capable of deeds. Thus is Ragnarok! The great antagonism pervading the world is removed in a final struggle, in which the contending powers mutually destroy each other. Ragnarok is an outbreak of all the chaotic powers, a conflict between them and the established order of creation. Fire, water, darkness, and death work together to destroy the world. The gods and their enemies meet in a universal, world-embracing wrestle and duel, and mutually destroy each other. The flames of Surt, the supreme fire-god, complete the overthrow, and the last remnant of the consumed earth sinks into the ocean.',\n",

Thor cunningly detains him all night by asking him questions concerning the various worlds he has visited. Alvis answers and teaches him the names by which the most important things in nature are called in the respective languages of different worlds: of men, of the gods, of the vans, of the giants, of the elves, of the dwarfs, and finally of the realms of the dead and of the supreme god. The dwarf, being one of those mythical objects which cannot endure the light of day, was detained till dawn without accomplishing his object. The eleventh poem is Vegtam’s Lay. Odin assumes the name Vegtam. In order to arrive at certainty concerning the portentous future of the gods, he descends to Niﬂheim, goes into the abodes of Hel, and calls the vala up from her grave-mound, asking her about the fate of Balder. She listens to him indignantly, answers his questions unwillingly, but at last discovers that Vegtam is the king of the gods, and angrily tells him to ride home. We will omit a synopsis of the remainder, and merely give their titles, as they do not enter so completely into the system of mythology as the first eleven (12) Rigsmaal (Song of Rig), (13) The Lay of Hyndla, (14) The Song of Volund, (15) The Song of Helge Hjorvardson, (16) Song of Helge Hundingsbane I, (17) Song of Helge Hundingsbane II, (18) Song of Sigurd Fafnisbane I, (19) Song of Sigurd Fafnisbane II, (20) Song Of Fafner, (21) Song of Sigdrifa, (22) Song of Sigurd, (23) Song of Gudrun I, (24) Song of Gudrun III, (25) Brynhild’s Ride to Hel, (26) Song of Gudrun II, (27) Song of Gudrun III, (28) The Weeping of Odrun, (29)',\n",

The original meaning of the word rune is secret, and it was used to signify a mysterious song, mysterious doctrine, mysterious speech, and mysterious writing. Our ancestors had an alphabet called runes, before they learned the so-called Roman Characters. The runic stave row was futhorc (f, a, ih, o, r, k), not an alphabet (A, B) as in Greek or Latin. But what does it mean mythologically, that Odin is the inventor of the runes? Odin himself says in his famous Rune-song in the Elder Edda: 'I know that I hung On a wind-rocked tree, Nine whole nights, With a spear wounded And to Odin Offered, Myself to myself; On that tree Of which no one knows From what root its springs. Bread no one gave me Nor a horn of drink, Downward I peered, To runes applied myself Wailing learnt them, Then fell down thence. Potent songs nine From the famed son I learned Of Bolthorn, Bestla’s father, And a draught Obtained Of the precious mead, Drawn from Odroerer. Then I began to bear fruit And to know many things.'

It is, for one thing, the latest; it continued in these regions of Europe till the eleventh century: eight hundred years ago the Norwegians were still worshipers of Odin. It is interesting also as the creed of our fathers; the men whose blood still run in our veins whom doubtless we still resemble in so many ways. Strange: they did believe that, while we believe so differently. Let us look a little at this poor Norse creed, for many reasons. We have tolerable means to do it; for there is another point of interest in these Scandinavian mythologies: that they have been preserved so well. Neither is there no use in knowing something about this old Paganism of our fathers. Unconsciously, and combined with higher things, it is in us yet, that old faith withal. To know it consciously brings us into closer and clearer relations with the past, with our own possessions in the past. For the whole past, as I keep repeating, is the possession of the present. The past had always something true, and is a precious possession. In a different time in a different place, it is always some other side of our common human nature that has been developing itself.
