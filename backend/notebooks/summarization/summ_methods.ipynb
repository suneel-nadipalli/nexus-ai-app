       "'Mythology is an integral part of \\nreligion. It is as necessary for religion and \\nnational culture as the skin and the \\nskeleton that preserve a fruit with its juice \\nand its taste. Form is no less essential than \\nsubstance. Myth ology and holy figures are \\nnecessary for any great culture to rest on \\nits stable spiritual foundation and function \\nas a life -giving inspiration and guide.  \\nLet us keep ever in our minds the fact \\nthat it is the Ramayana and the \\nMahabharata that bind our vast  numbers \\ntogether as one people, despite caste, \\nspace and language that seemingly divide \\nthem.  \\n1. THE CONCEPTION  \\nTo the north of the Ganga was the great \\nkingdom Kosala, made fertile by the river \\nSarayu. Its capital was Ayodhya, built by \\nManu, the famous ru ler of the Solar \\ndynasty. From Valmiki\\'s description of \\nthe capital Kosala, it is clear that ancient \\nAyodhya was not inferior to our modern \\ncities. Even in ancient India city \\ncivilisation had reached a high level.  \\nKing Dasaratha ruled the kingdom \\nfrom the capital city of Ayodhya. He had \\nfought on the side of the Devas, and his \\nfame spread in the three worlds. He was \\nthe equal of Indra and Kubera. The people \\nof Kosala were happy, contented and \\nvirtuous. The land was protected by a \\nmighty army, and no enemy c ould come \\nanywhere near  \\nIt contained forts with moats around \\nthem as well as many defensive \\nintallations, and true to its name, Ayodhya \\ndefied all enemies. (Ayodhya means that \\nwhich cannot be subdued by war). \\nDasaratha had eight wise ministers, ever \\nready to advise him and execute his \\norders. Great sages like Vasishtha and \\nVamadeva and other Brahmanas taught \\nthe dharma and performed rituals and \\nsacrifices.  Taxes were light and punishment of \\ncrime was just and inflicted according to \\nthe capacity of the wrong -doer. \\nSurrounded by the best counsellors and \\nstatesmen, the king\\'s splendor shone as the \\nrising sun. Many years rolled smoothly \\nby. In the midst of all this prosperity \\nDasaratha had one regret; he had no son.  \\nOne day in early summer he thought of \\nperformi ng a horse sacrifice for progeny. \\nHe consulted his religious masters and on \\ntheir advice, got sage Rishyasringa to \\nperform the Yaga. The Yaga was a grand \\naffair and the invitees included many of \\nthe kings of the day. It was no easy thing \\nto perform yagas. The location and \\nerection of the sacrificial platform had to \\nbe attended to in detail strictly according \\nto prescribed rules. There were experts \\nwhose guidance was sought in arranging \\nthings.  \\nIt meant the building of a new camp -\\ncity, capable of accommodati ng tens of \\nthousands and providing hospitality and \\nentertainment for the invitees who \\nincluded the princes and sages of the land. \\nIn short, yagas in those days were \\nsomething like our present -day State -\\nsponsored big scale conferences and \\nexhibitions.  \\nWhen all arrangements were complete \\nthe ceremonies were set in motion strictly \\nas enjoined by the Shastras.  \\nContemporaneously with the yaga in \\nAyodhya, there was a conference of the \\nDevas in heaven. The Devas complained \\nto Lord Brahma that Ravana, king of the \\ndemons, drunk with the power acquired \\nby the boon granted to him by Brahma, \\nwas causing them untold misery and \\nhardship. They represented to Brahma: \"It \\nis beyond our capacity to subdue, conquer \\nor kill Ravana. In the security of your \\nboon, he has grown wic ked and insolent \\nand ill -treats all, even women. His desire \\nis to dethrone Indra. You are our only '"
